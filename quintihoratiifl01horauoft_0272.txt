236 HORATII CARMJNA.

1. 3 ‘ Peripateticorum familia,’ and Horace himself, Epp. 1. 1. 13 ¹ quo
me duce, quo lare, tuter.’
15. Hiberis. Spanish steel was famous, Plin. N. H. 34. 41 and 43.
16. tendis, sor ⁴ tendere? of purpose or effort, with infinitive‚ cp. Epp.
1. 7. 31, 1. 19. 16, Virg. Aen. 1.18.

ODE XXX.

‘Queen Venus, leave Cyprus and bring thy presence to the shrine
which Glycera offers thee, and bring with thee love and grace and
youth and wit.⁷

The Ode is a hymn os the kind which the Greeks called κλητικοί,
hymnis of invitation? see on Alcman, Fr. 10. Ed. Bergk, Κύπρον ἱμερτὰν
λιποῖσα καὶ Πάφον περιρρύταν, a line of which we may possibly hear an
echo in ‘ Sperne dilectam Cypron.⁷

Line 1. Cnidi, in Caria3 Κνίδιοι τιμῶσιν Ἀφροδίτην μάλιστα, Paus.
1. Ι. 3.

Paphi, in Cyprus: Hom. Od. 8. 262 ‘H δ’ ἄρα Κύπρον ἵκανε φιλομμεῖδης
Ἀφροδίτη Ἐς Πάφον, ἔνθα δέ οἱ τέμενος Βωμός τε θυήεις; Virg. Aen. 1.
415. Tacitus describes the worship of Venus at Paphos, Hist. 2. 2.

¹2. sperne dilectam, Od. 1. 19. 9 ‘Venus Cyprum deseruit.' So
faunus must leave Lycaeus to visit Horace's Lucretilis: and Apollo,
when he would visit Delos, ‘deserit hibernam Lyciam‚' Virg. Aen.
4· 143·

4. aedem, ‘temple,' not ‘house‚' according to the distinction laid
down by Bentl. on Epp. 2. 2. 92 between ‘aedes' in the sing. and in the
plur. There is nothing strange in supposing either that a little shrine
or ‘ sacrarium ⁹ is dignified with the larger title, or that the whole house
is called a temple of the goddess.

5. fervidus, Yirg. Aen. 1. 710 ‘ Flagrantesque dei [Cupidinis] vultus.’

solutis Gratiae zonis, Od. 3. ¹9· 16 ‘ Gratia nudis iuncta sororibus)
cp. 4. 7. 5. Seneca describes the representations of them, de’Ben. 13
‘Tres Gratiae sorores manibus implexis ridentes iuvenes et virgines
solutaque et pellucida veste) The notion seems to be the absence of
restraint and of disguise—the grace of nature. They are joined with
the nymphs in Od. 4. 7. 5, and in Ι, 4. 6.

6. properentque. Dillr. has a note (on Od. 2. 7. 25) on Horace’s
not uncommon practice of joining an enclitic particle to some word
other than the one which it logically couples to the preceding clause.
In all these cases the word to which it is joined is emphatic and is
usually a common clement in the two clauses. the verb or adverb which
gives their meaning to both, and which is placed in this way between
