328 HORATIJ CARMINA.

1 3. mirum quod foret. The subjunctive expresses, if not a purpose,
at least a result foreseen at the time of the action : ‘to be the marvel of
all that.' etc. Cp. Virg. E. 9. 48 ‘ processit . . Astrum quo segetes gau-
derent frugibus.'

14. nidum Acherontiae, of a town nestling, where you would not
look for it, on a ledge of a hill. So Cic. (le Orat. 1. 44 ⁴ Ithacam illam
in asperrimis saxulis tanquam nidulum affixam.' Acerenza retains the
name and site of the ancient town. ‘ It is built on a hill of considerable
elevation, precipitous on three sides, and affording only a very steep
approach on the fourth)

15. Bantinos, on the borders of Lucania and Apulia, sor Pliny speaks
of it as belonging to the former, Lixy to the latter. The name is pre-
served in the convent of Sta. Maria di Banzi.

16. Forenti. The name (Forcnza) still remains in the locality, but,
is at present applied to a village on a hill. The Pseudo-Acron speaks
of the ancient village having been deserted in his time, ‘nunc sine habi-
tatore est? ⁴

17. ut . . ut, explaining the subject of their wonder, ‘ how it could be
that 1 slept‚' etc. Horace has ‘ mirabimur ut’ in Epod. 16. 53.

18. saera, the bay to Apollo, the myrtle to Venus; and so they are
emblematic both of the future poet and specially of the poet of love.
‘ Collata,' like ‘ sacra‚’ is intended to cover both substantives. See 2. 15.
18-20 n. '

20. non sine cus, οὐ θεῶν ἄτερ, οὐκ ἀθεεί (Hom. Od. 18. 3535. This
is their explanation of the marvel : ⁶ such bravery in a babe must come
from the gods, and must be under their special protectum? ‘ And so it
wass Horace continues, ‘1 was under the Muses‘ care, and have been
all my life?

22. tollor, the Muses take him, as a god snatches a hero from the
fight in Homer, and carry him up ⁴ in montes et in arcem ex urbe' (Sat.
2. 6. 16). Cp. Od. 2. 7. 13.

23. seu..seu.. seu. An apodosis must be applied to each sup-
position‚ ‘ or if Praeneste be my choice, or Tibur, or Baiae‚' ‘ibi vester
sum‚' ‘ eo vester feror.’ The epithets contrast the situations: the breezy
hill-top (Praeneste is 2100 feet above the sea), the sloping hill-side
(⁵ supinum' must refer to the S. W. side of Tibur, where the hill slopes
gently towards the Campagna)‚ and the sea-shore.

25. amicum, the welcome guest in the haunts of the Muses. Ι. 26. 1
‘ Musis amicus.'

fontibus et choris, 1. 26. 6; Hes. Theog. 3 (of the Muses) καί τε
περὶ κρήνην ἰοειδέα πύσσ’ ἁπαλοῖσιν Ὀρχεῦνται.

26. ‘Not the rout at Philippis 2. 7. 13.

27. devota, sc. ⁶ dis inferis,’ and so ‘accursed.' Epod. 16. 9.
