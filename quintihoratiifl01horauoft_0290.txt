254 HORA TII CARMINA.

described to illustrate the fall of Troy, is itself spoken of in metaphorical
terms which recall a ‘ warrior overthrown.'

ambitiosior, ‘ more closely clinging‚' from the original sense of
‘ambire,' which occurs in Ovid‚ Met. 2. 355, of the sisters of Phaethon
being turned into trees, ‘ cortex . . uterum pectusque humerosque manus-
que ambit! Pliny uses ‘ ambitiosus ’ of a river in the sense of ‘ winding'
(N. H. 5. 15).

ODE XXXVII.

A song of triumph, written when the news reached Rome, in Sep-
tember, ac. 30, of the death of Cleopatra and Antony (Dio C. 51. 19).
Compare Epod. 9, which celebrates their defeat at Actium in the pre-
ceding year. Ἄγε may note the absence from both Ode and Epode
(see esp. on v. 13) of the name of Antonius. Octavianus has conquered
not a Roman rival, but a foreign enemy: ‘Senatus Cleopatrae non
Antonio bellum indixerat (Dio C. 50. 6) : de illa triumphum non de hoc
decrevit (Dio C. 51. 19).' Ritter.

‘ Now is the time for merriment and thanksgiving, private and public;
now, and not before, while the great queen was plotting wild schemes
of destruction against Rome. Her madness was cooled at the sight of
her fieet in flames. Blind panic became reasonable terror when she
fied before Caesar as a dove before a hawk. Yet she was no vulgar
woman. She could brave out her fortune, and look death in the face
rather than adorn a Roman triumph.⁷ As Horace paints the fierce
barbaric queen, her recklessness and her fortitude, he is bringing out
in stronger relief the danger from which Rome has been freed, and the
glory of Octavianus, who has conquered no unworthy foe.

The opening of the Ode was doubtless modelled on the Ode of
Alcaeus upon the death of Myrsilus (Fr. 20, Bergk), of which we have

two lines preserved in Athen. x. p. 430, A :—

νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην καί τινα πρὸς βίαν
πίνην, ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος.
