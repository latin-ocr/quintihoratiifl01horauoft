way, each clause has to borrow something to complete the antithesis
from the other. ‘ Pauper ruris colonus ² implies its converse, the riches
os the trader3 ‘dominam aequoris’ is meant to suggest that she dis-
tributes also the treasures of the country.

7. Bithyna, perhaps rather, like ‘Cypria trabe? Od. 1. 1. 13, as
coming from or trading to Bithynia, a seat of commerce, Od. 3. 7. 3,
Epp. 1. 6. 33, than as built of Bithynian timber. ‘ Pontica pinus‚' Od.
1. 14. 11.

lacessit, ⁴ tempts‚’ as though the sea were a wild beast which it was
dangerous to go too near3 ‘non tangenda vada,’ Od. 1. 5. 24.

8. Carpathium, the sea between Rhodes and Crete, named from the
island Carpathus. Like ‘Bithyna' it is merely a special name for a
general. There is a point, however, in naming as many countries, and
those as distant from one another, as may be.

9. asper, the Dacian who stands fiercely at bay (cp. ‘tigris aspera,‘
Od. 1. ²3- 9) is contrasted with the nomad Scythians who, if attacked‚
retreat into their boundless steppeS. These again, perhaps with more
settled peoples‚ ‘ urbesque! The object of all the epithets is to insist
on the universality of Fortune’s sway (cp. 1. 34. 9-1 1, 3. 4. 45-48). No
distance nor difference of lise exempts men from it. This is brought
out equally by the antithetical form of v. 9 and by the quick accumula-
tion of copulatives in vv. 10-·12.

1 1, 12. The mothers of eastern princes sear for their sons, as Atossa
for Xerxes (cp. Od. 3. 2. 7), and princes in the midst of their splendid
state sear for themselves.

13. iniurioso, ὑβριστικῷ, ⁴ contumelious‚' Epod. 17. 33.

ne . . neu, not two different dangers; the second is only one form of
the danger metaphorically described in the first clause.

14. columnam. The pillar seems to be purely metaphorical as an
emblem of stability. Cp. the metaphor in Aesch. Pers. 162 μὴ μέγας
πλοῦτος κονίσας omas ἀντρέψῃ ποδὶ ὄλβον ὃν Δαρεῖος ἦρεν. Some editors
have thought of the column erected in the Forum by the people in
memory of Julius Caesar, and destroyed again by Dolabella, Suet. Jul.
85, Cic. Phil. 1. 2.

frequens, ‘ crowding,’ ‘ gathering in erowds.’

15. ⁶ Arouse to arms the loiterers, to arms ' ; ‘ ad arma ’ is the actual
cry. Ovid imitates the repetition, Met. 11. 377 ‘Cuncti coeamus et
arma, Arma capessamus'; 12. 241 ‘ Certatimque omnes uno ore arma,
arma loquuntur.‘

17. saeva, ‘stern‚’ ep. Od. ῐ. 28. 20. The balance of MS. authority
is in favour of the rival reading ‘serva,’ which Aer. and Porph. found;
the latter interprets it ² slavish,’ i.e. bringing slavery with it; the former,
though he offers this as an alternative, takes it in what, if we retain it,
