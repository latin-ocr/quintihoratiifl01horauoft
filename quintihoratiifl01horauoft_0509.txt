NOTES. EPODE Vl. 473

94. deorum manium, the spirits of the dead ; literally, according to
Curtius, Grundz. p. 294, the ‘good’ powers, ‘manis’ being the opposite
of ‘immanis’ Cp. Cic. de Leg. 2. 9 ‘Deorum manium iura sancta

· 5111110. 1105 1610 datos divos habento)

 

100. Esquilinae, the birds of carrion that haunted the slopes of the
Esquiline, still the ‘miserae plebis commune sepulch1·um‚' Sat. 1. 8. 10.
For 1116 hiatus, the diphthong being §horte—ned, cp. Sat. 1. 9. 38 ‘ Si me
amas inquit,’ and such instances in Virgilas Aen. 3. 21 1 ‘ Insulae Joni0‚'

etc.
EPODE VI.

⁸ You are like a watch-dog who flies at a guest but is afraid of a wolf.
Turn your impotent attack on υἱεῖ l have 166111 ; l follow my quarry to
the death. Yon bark loud enough, but will turn aside for a piece of
meat. Β611’316,Ι am a bull with sharp horus, and ready to attack those
who deserve 11, 35 ready as Archilochus or Hipponax. Ι 1ν111 not take

an insult.’

In assailing the wrong use of the poetry of invective, Horace indicates

its right 1156. The 1111511561 of iambic verse attacks the innocent and
'defencelesa and 15 ready to 06 bought off. What can we wish better
than that he should provoke the true wielder of Archilochus' weapon
and be the object instead of the writer of an Epode'?

The person intended 15 not known. Acron calls him ‘ Cassium male-
dicum poetam.' The Comm. Cruq. further identifies him with Cassius
Severus, an orator of name (Quint. 10. Ι. 177), 0111 a libellous writer

, (Τ36. Α1111. Ι. 72). He is known to have died A.D. 32, and it is perhaps
hardly probable that he can have written lampoons such as to attract
Horace's anger (as this would oblige us to suppose) at the least sixty-
, three years before, Nor 15 there any hint elsewhere of his having been
a poet. Ritter suggests Furius Bibaculus, who is elsewhere ridiculed
by Horace (see on Sat. 1. 10. 37, 2. 5. 41), and who 15 classed with
Catullus by Quintilian (10. 1. 96) as a writer of bitter ⁶ 13111013 ‘ [iambi]
’“ cuius acerbitas in Catullo, Bibaculo, non in Horatio reperietur,' and
⁷ who is named by Tac. Ann. 4 34 as a lampooner of the Caesarian

family.

Line Ι. Compare Cicero's comparison of 366115615 to watch-dogs who
are apt to bark at the wrong persons, pro Rosc. Am. 20. Cp. also
Horace's expression sor well-directed satire, Sat. 2. 1. 84 ‘Si quis Op-
probriis dignum latraverit.'

3. There 15 high MS. authority (including V) for ‘verte’ and (al-
though the reading of Vis not so 61631) for ‘petest B has ‘vertis’ altered
to ‘ verte‚’ and ‘petesff No MS. gives the transposition ‘verte si potes‚’
