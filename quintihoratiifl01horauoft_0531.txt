ΟΝ THE UNKNOWN NAMES IN THE ODES.

IT is hardly necessary to read Estre's summary of the many
and mutually destructive theories that have been proposed in
order to perceive the sutility of attempting to construet out
of the Pyrrhas‚ Lalages‚ Lydias of the Odes a history of
Horace's loves and disappointments. Whatever foundation
any Ode may have had in the feelings or facts of the moment
it is impossible now to distinguish shadow from substance3
and there is much to indicate that Horace did not wish it to be
otherwise. XVhatever be their origin, he treats his love Odes
as artistic studies. He arranges them not, we can feel sure, in
any chronological order as remembrances of his own life, but
where they will be most useful to relieve more serious poems
or to stand side by side as companion pictures. We may see
as much as this from the nature of the names which he employs.
A certain number owe their selection obviously to their etymo-
logical meaning, such as Pyrrha in 1. 5, Chloe in 1. 23, Lyce in
3. 10, Phidyle in 3. 23 (cp. Sybaris in 1. 83 the list may possibly
be extended by the names of Lalage in 1. 22, Leuconoe in 1. ΙΙ,
and of Telephus Ι. 13, etc. Horace is fond of playing on the
‘ meaning of names, ‘Glycerae immitis‚³ Ι. 33. 2, ‘ Bibuli consulis
amphoram‚' 3. 28. 8, ⁴ Dulci Lyaeo solvere‚' Epod. 9. 38). Some
more are suspiciously well adapted to the metre of the special
poem ; Leuconoe has this reason at any rate for her existence,
so has ‘Asterie' in 3. 7, and ‘ Neobule' (cp. the name of her
lover, ‘Liparaeus Hebrus ³) in the Ionic a minore metre of3. 12.
With one or two exceptions the unknown male names inthe
