NOTES. EPODE Vll. 475

Does anger blind you, or sate eompel you, or is it mere wauton wicked-
ness'? Shame makes them silent, 1 will answer for them. It is the bitter

heritage of fratricidal bloodshed which descends to us from the death
os Remus.‘

There is nothing to fix with precision thc date of the Epode. It
expresses horror at the prospect of some fresh outburst of civil war. It
' is of course possible, as the Scholiasts say, that it may express the first
feeling with which Horace witnessed the renewal of the struggle after
Caesar's death, although he was very soon to be involved in the war
himself. More probably it refers to some later moment, the commence-
ment, it may be, as Orelli thinks, of the ‘war of Perusia ’ in 41 ; but a
mere rumour of war is enough to account for such a poem. The idea
of the conclusion is Greek not Roman. The explanation offered in it of
the succession os civil strise is sanciful and literary‚ without the definite
politica] meaning which underlies the mythological form of such poems

as Od. 1.2. Compare in this respect, as in others, Epod. 16, which
belongs to the same period.

Line 5—8. ‘ Not as our fathers shed their blood for foreign conquest,
nor as we might shed ours to complete their conquests.’

7. intactus: ‘ integer,’ Od. 4. 4. 66, ‘non ante devictus] Macleane
thinks that both couplets refer to expioits already accomplished, ‘to
achieve such victories as Scipio or Julius Caesar.' But the conquest of

· Britain is to Horace even in the Odes a triumph still in the future. If

we assign even the earliest date to the Epode‚ Caesar⁷s invasion was
long enough past sor its small results to have been estimated, and there
was no political reason for exaggerating them.

descenderet, to be explained in connection with the expression ‘sacer
clivus’ in Od. 4. 2. 35, see note there. The triumphal procession de-
scended by the ‘Sacra via' into the Forum, through which it passed to the
Capitoline hill. Before the ascent of that began the captives were led
aside from the ranks. Cp. Cic. Verr. 5. 30 ‘Cum de foro in Capitolium
currum flectere incipiunt illos duci in carcerem iubent; idemque dies et
victoribus imperi et victis vitae finem facit.'

9. sua dextera, Epod. 16. 2 ‘Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit?

11, 12. feris serves to explain ‘hic mos‚' as though it were ‘ut feri
essent‚' so that it shares in the general negation and exception, ‘this was
never the wont of wolves or lions to turn their rage save on some other
kind.' There is no need with Bentley to read ‘ nunquam.' ‘ Dispar ' is
used by Cic. Tusc. 5. 13 for animals of a different species. Bentley
compares, for the sentiment, Juv. 15. 159 solt, Plin. N. H. 7. 1 ‘leonum
feritas inter se non dimicat.’ Sen. Epp. 95 ‘ curn inter se mutis ac feris
pax sit‚' and notices the growth of humanity and logie in the interval;
