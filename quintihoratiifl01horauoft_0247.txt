super mero. Ritter takes ‘super,’ of place, over the spilt wine;
Orelli, of respect=‘de,’ as ‘ civiles super urbe curas,' Od. 3. 18. 17.
In the legend, however, wine is not the ground of the quarrel. Dillr.
thinks that Virgil’s ‘nocte super media,' Aen. 9. 61, will justify us in
taking it of time, ‘ after.⁷

9. debellata, see on Od. 1. 3. 13.

Sithoniis, properly the inhabitants of the middle finger of the three

9, 10. ‘There is warning in the heaxy hand of Evius on the Sitho-
nians, when in their greedy haste they divide right and wrong by the
slender line of their own appetite,’ i. e. when the only distinction they
place between right and wrong is whether they desire the thing or not.

divine youth; Epod. 3. 9 ‘ candidum ducem‚’ of Jason.

a foxskin worn by the Bacchants. Horace puts ‘ 1 and those who
agree with me will be moderate in the use of wine,⁷ into language

untimely hand on thy rites.'

solemn lifting of the sacred ‘ cista‚' which contained the emblems of the
god, ‘ commotis excita saeris Thyias,’ Virg. Aen. 4. 301.

variis, Theoc. 26. 3 gives a list of the leaves gathered by the Bac-

‘Plangebant alii proceris tympana palmis, Multis raucisonos efflabant
cornua bombos?
