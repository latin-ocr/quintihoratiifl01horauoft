ODES, BOOKS J-JJJ. 7

which is related by Dio 51. 18, and by Justinus 42. 5. 5.
Phraates IV, to whom Orodes I had resigned his throne in B.C.
38, after some years of tyranny‚ provoked his subjects to the
point of rebellion. He was expelled, and Tiridates, another
member of the Arsacid house, though his exact relationship to
Phraates is unknown, was put on the throne in his place. After
a short time Phraates was restored (Justinus adds, by the inter-
vention of the Scythians, which explains probably the allusion
of Od. 1. 26. 3—5>, and Tiridates fied to seek the protection of
Augustus, carrying with him the infant son of Phraates. These
events are undoubtedly the objects of reference in Od. 1. 26. 5,
2. 2. 17, 3. 8. 19, and very probably also in 1. 34. 14—16 and 3.
29- 28. If we could date them therefore with certainty we
should know the earliest time at which the first-named Odes at
least could have been written. And it so happens that this
would incidentally throw light on one or two more points of
Horatian chronology ; for 3. 8 is written on an anniversary <it
seems almost necessarily the first anniversary‚ of Horace’s
escape from the falling tree. To fix, therefore, the earliest date
of this Ode would determine as much for the other Odes which
refer to the accident, i.e. 2. 13 and 3. 4. Horace’s escape
again is connected (2. 17. 21-30) with Maecenas' reception in
the theatre on his recovery from illness, and this in its turn
gives a date of some kind to Ι. 20. The date, however, on
which so much depends is not itself quite free from doubt.
Justinus says that Tiridates fied to Augustus, ‘ who was at that
time fighting in Spain,' which would fix the date to Rc. 25.
Dio, on the contrary, narrates the event under the year 30, and
makes Tiridates find Augustus in Syria, on his progress
through Asia after the battle of Actium. This seems more
probable in itself than the story of his journey to Spain3 and
the earlier date is the one now generally accepted. A confirma-
tion ofit is found in Od. 3. 4, which contains a reference to the
falling tree, and which yet, both by its relation to the other
Odes at the beginning of Book iii, and by the allusion of v. 37
foll„ seems to be fixed to a date earlier than B.C. 26-25. Another
point of some interest has been supposed to be involved in the
