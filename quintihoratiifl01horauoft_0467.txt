NOTES. BOOK JV, ODE [X. 431

sang, many a Helen loved, many a Troy was besieged, many a Hector
or Deiphobus fought and died for wife and children. Why are they
unwept‚ unknown? Because they had no inspired chronicler; and, when
once forgotten, what good is lest of their heroisin? It shall not be so
with you, Lollius, if Ι can help it. You have the mind osa statesman
—clear sighted, well balanced, proof against avarice, ruler of all things,
because it rules itself. Such is the one wise and happy man, who is
independent of circumstances, who can use prosperity well, and not
shrink from poverty or death in a good cause.’

Lollius (⁶ M. Lollius M. F.' His cognomen is unknown; see on
Epp. 1. 2. Ι) had been consul Bc. 21 (Epp. 1. 20. 28). For his tempo-
rary defeat by the Sygambri in nc. 16 see Introd. to this Book. His
character stands very low with other writers. Pliny, H. N. 9. 35. 58,
and Vell. Patere. 2. 9, accuse him specially of avarice and venality.
This is in strange contradiction to Horace's panegyric, in which such
stress is laid on his sreedom from these particular vices. The public
voice can hardly, at the time Horace wrote, have endorsed the accusa-
tions, or the boldness of meeting Lollius’ calumniators on their own
ground would have raised ridicule rather than sympathy. Something
no doubt must be deducted from Velleius' testimony on the score of his
partiality to Tiberius, whose enmity Lollius had specially incurred
(Suet. Tib. 12, 13); and Pliny would very likely have followed Velleius.
But Lollius, notwithstanding the failure of his German campaign, con-
tinued in the intimacy and confidence of Augustus, as is shown by the.
fact that he was sent by him to the East as the companion and adviser
of his grandson Caius Caesar in nc, 2. The issue of Lollius’ campaign
on the Rhine had not been unsuccesssul; and it is likely enough that
Horace would rush to the rescue of a friend of his own and of the
emperor's, against whom, in the moment of what may have seemed a
single and undeserved failure, the world had begun to breathe graver
charges, possibly such as were subsequently shown to be true, but such

as his friends in Rome could still discredit.

Line 1 . ne forte eredas, not a direct prohibition, in which sense Horace
would rather say ‘ ne credideris' (see on 1. 33. 1), but as in Epp. 1. 1.
13 (‘Ae ne sorte roges quo me duce quo lare tuter: Nullius addictus
iurare in verba magistri Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deseror hospes‘3
cp. Sat. 2. 1. 80), giving the negative purpose of the following statement.
'To prevent your fancying, as perhaps you might, that my poetry will
die, let me remind you of the fame of other lyric poets’ The preamble
serves to connect the discourse on lyric poetry with the stanzas about
Lollius personally. ‘ Lest you should undervalue an Ode from me, I will
proceed “pretium dicere muneri ‘'.’
