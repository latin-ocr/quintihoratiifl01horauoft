might rank them together.

17. Elea palma. The Olympian Odes are taken as representatives
of the ἐπινίκια.

18. caelestes, ‘very denizens of heaven’; see on 1. 1. 6 ‘terrarum
dominos evehit ad deos.'

equum, as Pindar makes mention of Pherenicus, Hiero's horse,
Ol. 1. 18, Pyth. 3. 74; but singing of horses may well mean of their
riders. ,

21. fiebili, ‘ tearsul,' as ‘ flebilis Ino‚’ A. P. 123.

ve varies the ‘sive,' ‘ sive‚' of the last two stanzas, although he is

contrasts Pindar's higher flights and original inspiration with his own
humble aims and laborious imitative method, ‘gathering honey from
flower to flower of Greek lyrics, and enshrining it in the “curiosa
felicitas '’ of 1115 own poetica] style '; in v. 29, ‘ circa nemus . . Tiburis‚'
