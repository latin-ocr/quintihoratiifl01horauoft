ODE XXIV.

Of the person whose death is the subject of this Ode we know
nothing but what is contained in the statement of the Chronicon of
Eusebius (An. 264-34o)‚ which, opposite the year A.v.c. 730, ΒΕ. 24,
has (in the Latin version of Jerome) ‘Quintilius Cremonensis Vergilii
et Horatii familiaris moritur! We may notice that the mention of
Cremona makes him a neighbour of Virgil. The Scholiasts on Horace
eall him Quintilius Varus, and add that he was a Roman knight,
identifying him with the Quintilius of A. Ρ. 438, see on v. 8, and with
Varus of Od. 1. 18.

The Ode is not merely, as Porph. describes it, ‘ θρῆνος in Quintilium
sodalem Vergilii) The Pseudo-Aer. characterizes it more justly, ‘ Con-
solatur Vergilium impatienter amici sui mortem lugentem.' Horace's
feeling is for Virgil as much as for their common friend. From this
point of view we must be struck by the delicacy of the ‘ consolation?
He justifies Virgil⁷s grief, he shares it. ‘ He too will join in the dirge;
Quintilius is gone, the peerleSS‚ the soul of modesty, honour, justice,
and truthv All good men weep; and who has greater right to weep
than Virgil, whose piety and trustfulness the gods have so hardly
rewarded ’'? Only at last, when he has opened his friend's heart by his
expression of sympathy, does he venture on a hint, not perhaps of com-
fort, but of sels-restraint. ‘ After all, no laments, though sweeter than
Orpheus, no pmyers, will reach the dead. It is a cruel fate, patience
only will lighten what may not be cured.’

It would seem, if Donatus be giving a genuine trait of Virgil in his
Life, c. 18, that Horace is recalling his friend to his own philosophy
for consolation: ‘ Solitus erat dicere nullam virtutem commodiorem

homini esse patientia, ac nullam adeo asperam esse fortunam quam
prudenter patiendo vir fortis non vincat!

Line 2. praecipe, ‘teach me.' The Muse herself is to sing, cp. Od. 1.
1 2. 1. Horace will only hear her voice and repeat the strain aster her.

3. Melpomene, see on Od. 1. 1. 33, and cp. 3. 30. 16, 4. 3. 1.

5. ergo, S. 2. 5. 101 ⁶ Ergo nunc Dama sodalis Nusquam est’? ep.
Virg. E. 1. 47 ‘Fortunate senex, ergo tua rura manebunt? So Ovid
begins Trist. 3. 2. 1 ·' Ergo erat in fatis Scythiam quoque visere nostris²

Like the Gr. ἄρα, it indicates a conclusion forced on the speaker to his
surprise.
