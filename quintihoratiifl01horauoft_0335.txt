NOTES. BOOKIl, ODE XVII. 299

how much feeling of the metaphor remains in either ‘ spiritum’ or
‘tenuem' lf this passage stood alone we should have no difficulty in
interpreting ‘tenuem ' of the fineness and delicaey of the air, but ‘ tenuis‚‘
like the Gr. λεπτός and corresponding words· in many langiiage5‚ is used
widely of nicety ofjudgment or taste or expression. Horace gives it in
this sense another metaphorical connection, Epp. 2. 1. 2²5 ‘tenui deducta
poemato filo) The rival interpretation of ⁶ tenuem spiritum ¹ as= ⁶ par-
ticulam aliquam exiguam spiritus’ is not so good. Horace's sarm is
‘ small,’ but we do not want to continue the depreciation of his lot, but
to enforce thedoctrine of the fair balancing of fortune by contrasting his
modest external means with the richnness of his mental gifts.

Camenae, used without scruple of the Greek Μοῦσαι. Cp. ⁶ Pindaricae
Camenae‚’ Od. 4. 9. 8.

39. non mendax dedit, Carm. S. 25 ‘ veraces cecinisse Parcae.'
‘Fate assigned to me that lot in days gone by, and she has kept her
word.’

malignum spernere volgus, either the same as Od. 3. 2. 23 ‘ [Virtus]
coetusque vulgares et udam Spernit humum fugiente penna '3 ‘ malignum'
being: ‘profanum ‘ in 3. 1. 1, or more likely referring to the envy which
his fortune and his rising fame brought with them, see on Od. 2.
20. 4-7.

ODE XVII.

⁶ Kill me not, Maecenas, with your dismal forebodings. 1f you are
going to die, I die too; so the gods will, and so Ι will. For myself, I
could not survive the one half of myselfz 1 have sworn, and will be true
to my oath of sealty ; where you go Ι will go, if the Chimaera 01· Gyas
were to rise to prevent it. And tlze gods will it too. Ι know not whether
Ι was born under a good star or a bad one, but my horoscope tallies
wonderfully with yours. Yon recovered from dangerous illness just
when I escaped the falling tree. Let us remember it, and in our several
ways thank the gods.'

Maecenas was an invalid (Plin. N. H. 7. 54 ‘ Quibusdam perpetua
febris est sicut C. Maecenati. Eidem triennio supremo nullo horae mo-
mento contigit somnus⁷)‚ and one that clung passionately to lise, if we
may trust his own lines preserved by Seneca, Epp. 101 ;--

‘Debilem facito manu,
Debilem pede, coxa,

Tuber adstrue gibberum‚
Lubricos quate dentes;

Vita dum superest, bene est!
. Hanc mihi vel acuta

Si sedeam cruce, sustine?
