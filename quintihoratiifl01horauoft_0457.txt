Line 1. Apollo is invoked first by virtue of his sterner attributes as an
avenger of ὕβρις. Three instances are given {rom mythology <accord-

Aeneadae, whose inveterate foe he thus removed.

magnae linguae, ‘a vaunting tongue'; Soph. Ant. 127 Ζεὺς γὰρ
μεγάλης γλώσσης κόμπους ὑπερεχθαίρει. The boast of Niobe was that
she had given birth to more children than Latona. The story is told

expressed in the first by the epithet of ⁴ Tityos raptor‚’ in the second by
the fuller account of Achilles' bearing towards the vanquished.

Tity0s3 α. 14. 8, 3. 4. 77, 3. 11. 21, Pind. P. 4. 90. His offence‚ an

Troiae semper miserate labores Dardana qui Paridis direxti tela
manusque Corpus in Aeacidae'; Sophocles attributes it directly to
Apollo, Phil. 334 NE. τέθνηκεν, ἀνδρὸς οὐδενός, θεοῦ δ’ ὕπο Ι τοξευτὸς ὡς

8. cuspide, his famous spear; Hom. Il. 19. 387 Ἐκ δ’ ἄρα σύριγγος
