306 HORA ΤΠ CARMIJM.

1. 35. 21, 2. 16. 21). ‘Destinare’ is especially used os tracing out the
site sor a building. Bentley quotes the Culex 391 ‘Conformare locum
capit impiger hunc et in orbem Destinat.'

Other ways of taking the lines are: (Ι) to make ‘ destinata’ agree
with ‘fine' in the sense of ‘ than the end of Orcus already traced for
him'; (2) to take ‘destinata' as a nominative with ‘aula,’ ‘no house
that he has planned awaits him more surely than the end of Orcus’;
(3) with Bentley to understand ‘ certior’ of the comparative certainty of
’ death to the rich and the poor. ‘ Nulla certior (h. e. non certior) aula
manet divitem herum [quam pauperem clientem] designata et descripta
termino ipsius Orci (h.e. aeque spatiosa ac ipse Orcus).' All these sacri—
fice a good deal of the personification of Orcus, which seems to be implied
in the remainder of the Ode, Bentley's most of all, so much so that he
wishes to read ‘capacis' It is to be observed that his interpretation
really necessitates this change, and this necessity is fatal to it. Death
must, on his view, be represented as a boon, otherwise the sentence
should have run ‘non certior manet pauperem quam divitem.’

32. quid ultra tendis recalls the ‘fine,’ ‘Death has set the limit,
why do you try to overpass it ’ἓ ’

32-end. ¹ Nothing excludes and nothing exempts? The equality is
enforced in the first clause by the opposition, ‘the pauper and the
prince' ; in the second by the accumulation of the qualities that might
be expected to make a difference, ‘ no wit, no wealth ’ ; in the third and
fourth by the double contrast (which has a direct application to the
oppressor) between proud Tantalus and his mythic race who would
escape death if they could, and the poor man who looks to it as the
end os his toils. The matter is clenched by the suggestion of the last
line that even for the poor man it is no matter of choice.

35. Promethea, see on 2. 13. 37. We seem to have a fresh point
added to the legend here. The ‘satelles Orci' is Charon, as appears

from the verb ‘ revexit?
36. hie, Orcus. ‘ Vocatus,' etc„ would hardly sm't Charon.

38. levare, after ‘ vocatus!
40. The form is like Thucyd. 1. 118 αὐτὸς (Apollo) ἔφη ξυλλήψεσθαι
καὶ παρακαλούμενος καὶ ἄκλητος. Halm (in the third edition of Orelli)

suggests that Horace was thinking of Aesop's fable of the old man and
Death, though the point there is different.
