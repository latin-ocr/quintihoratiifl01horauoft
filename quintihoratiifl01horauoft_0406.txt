13. fertur, perhaps =‘ they tell me‚’ a common way of indicating the
strangeness of what we report, as though we hardly ventured to vouch
for it. See on 3. 5. 41.

as Orelli thinks, only by letting the wind play on his shoulders.

ODE XXI.

XVritten in anticipation os entertaining M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus.
Dill‘. bids us compare with this Ode Epp. 1. 5.

‘ Cask of Massic, as old as myselfi your potent contents were kept for
some happy occasion, and they shall be broached to-day for Corvinus. .
He, philosopher as he is, will not despise you. Old Cato, they tell us,
did not object to a cup of wine. You make genius flow; you give fresh
hope to the anxious and courage to the poor. With your help, and

Liber and Venus and the Graces, we will keep the banquet up till
daylight?

Corvinus (the ‘ Messalla ' of Sat. 1. 6. 42, 1. 10. 85, A. P. 371 ‘ diserti
Messallae') was, like Pollio, distinguished at once in the politica] and
the literary world. He had belonged to the senatoriam party, and
turned Octavius' flank in the first day's fighting at Philippi. He subse-
quently joined Octavius against Antony, and commanded the centre of
his fleet at Actium. After the settlement he retired from active life,
and devoted himself to oratory and literature. He was the great friend
aud patron of Tibullus.

with the fourth and fifth stanzas should be compared Ovid’s imita-
tion, A. A. 1. 237 foll. :—

‘Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus aptos;
Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero.
