2 Ι 6 HORA TII CARMJNA.

3. Latonam, as the mother of the two (leities. Cp. Hymnin
Apoll. 14 χαῖρε μάκαιρ’ ὦ Λητοῖ ἐπεὶ τέκες ἄγλαα τέκνα. It is probably
ineant that both choruses should join in her praise; cp. Od. 3. 28. 9—16.
lie returns to the maidens in v. 5 ‘ vos!

5. laetam fluviis, as in Catull. 34. 5 ‘Montium domina ut sores

Silvarumque virentium Saltuumque reconditorum Amniumque sonan-
tium '; Pind. P. 2. 7 ποταμίας Ἀρτέμιδος.
- coma. Some of the best MSS. (V B τ) have ‘ comam‚’ which Acron
seems to have read and tried, against the sense, to take with ‘laetam
fluviis? Bentley defends it as Setting off the woods of Algidus, etc.
against Tempe and Delos, and ‘laetam fluviis⁷ against the ‘insignem
pharetra humerum' of the next stanza. But Horace would hardly have
tolerated the ambiguity of ‘laetam' not agreeing with ‘ comam,’ yet
without a visible substantive of its own. And though it is a natural
hyperbole to §peak of Diana's joy in ⁴ every leaf of the woods‚⁷ it would
be forced to bid the maidens sing of each leaf.

6. Algido, sacred to Diana; C. S. 79 ‘Quaeque Aventinum tenet
Algidumque) ‘ Mons Algidus' was the name of part of the eastern
side of the Alban hills. Its name is supposed to be still recognised in
the Cava dell* Aglio, the gorge by which the Via Latina issues from
them on the south-east. Its woods are celebrated in Od. 3. 23. 10, 4.
4· 57-

7. Erymanthi, a mountain on the north srontier of Arcadia.

8. Gragi, in Lycia, for Artemis as well as Apollo Aism’ ὄρεα διᾷσσει,
Soph. O. T. 208. ‘Nigris' is the epithet of ⁵ silvis' only so long as
it belongs to ⁵ Erymanthi'; in the second clause the epithet ‘viridis’
supplies its place, ⁴though grammatically attached to ‘ Cragi‚’ see on
Od, 2. 5. 13, 3. 23. 15. For the verbal antithesis ‘nigriS‚' ‘viridisff
cp. Od. Ι. 36. 15 ‘Neu vivax apium, neu breve lilium‚⁷ 2. 20. 3, and
1 1 ‘ asperae . . leves' ; 3. 27. 18. 19 ‘ ater . . albus.⁷ Horace is specially
fond of contrasts of colour, see on Od. 2. 3. 9, and cp. 1. 25. 17, 18
‘ hedera virente . . pulla myrtos The woods would be black from
pines, holm oaks‚ etc„ Od. 4. 4. 57; 4. 12. 11 ‘nigri colles Arcadiae.’

9. Tempe, where Apollo, according to the legend, purified himself
aster the slaughter of Pytho.

10. natalem Delon, Od. 3. 4. 63 ‘natalem silvam,’ Virg. Aen. 4.
144 ‘ Delon maternam.'

12. fraterna, for Hermes invented the ‘lyra,' though he gave it to
Apollo, Hom. Hymn. εἷς Ἑρμῆν. 490-502; see on Od. 3. 4. 4.

15. hic. Β and some other MSS. read ‘ hines see on Od. ῐ. 16. 14.
Bentley would read ‘ haec bellum . . hie miseram famem,’ ‘ne nihil
omnino agat Diana.' But Horace does not separate the functions of
the two deities. Both are ἀλεξίκακοι, ‘ averruncL’ The boys are to
