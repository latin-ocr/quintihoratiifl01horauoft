siderations. They turn mainly on Od. 1. 3, which is taken to
refer to the voyage of Virgil to Athens in the last year of his
life, B.C. 19 : and on the supposed allusions (the strongest case
is Od. 2. 9) to the expedition of Tiberius into Armenia, and the
restoration of the standards by the Parthians in B.C. 20. Some
remarks on these points will be found in the Introductions to
Od. 1. 3 and 2. 9. There remains the possibility that these (and
if these, then other> Odes may have been inserted after the first
publication. It will be seen that this is not likely to have been
the case with 1. 3; and the theory of any such insertions is
perhaps hardly compatible with that pause in lyric composition
between the publication of Books i—iii and the commencement
of Book iv, which is implied in Suetonius' statement, and in
Horace's own words, Od. 4. 1. 1, Epp. 1. 1. 1-10.

§3. When we pass from the general epoch to the date os
special Odes we are on less safe ground. A very few can be
fixed with exactness. Such are 1. 31, which is written for the
dedication of the temple of Apollo Palatinus in B.C. 283 2. 4,
which Horace dates himself in ΒΩ. 25, by reference to his own
age 3 1. 24 and 3. 14, both of which are fixed to B.C. 24, the one by
the known date of the death of Quintilius, the other by the return
ofAugustus from Spain. We may perhaps add a feW, though in
their case of course more latitude must be given, which speak
in terms of near anticipation of political events which can them—

, selves be dated. Such are 1. 35, which represent Augustus as

 

on the point of starting for Britain, a purpose for which we
know that he set out from Rome in B.C. 27 (see Introd. to that
Ode, Dio Cassius 53. 22, 25); and 1. 29, which seems to refer to
preparations more or less immediately preceding Aelius Gallus'
expedition into Arabia Felix in B.C. 24. Such again are the
Odes (2. 15 and 3. 6) in which we can hardly doubt the refer-
ἰ enee to the restoration of temples which Augustus undertook
² in the year 28.

§4 Those who would go much beyond this in fixing with
accuracy the date of single Odes have to lean a good deal on
Horace’s references to events on the frontier and beyond it,
’Ὗ movements of the Cantabrian, the Scythian, the Parthian. In
