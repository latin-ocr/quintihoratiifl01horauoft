NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXXIV. 245

stem which also appears in the Greek εὐ-διέσ-τερος, and ‘ with the Latin
change oss to ν’ in ‘ ho-dier·nus.'

7. plerumque. All the older commentators who notice the point
join ‘plerumque' with ‘egit‚’ not perceiving that Horace is speaking
of a single instance in his own experience. For the emphatic position
of ‘plerumque ' at the end os its clause Bentl. compares Epp. 2. 2. 84
and Lucr. 5. 1¹3¹·

purum, the cloudless sky; ‘sole puro,’ Od. 3. 29. 45; cp. 3. 10. 8.
Thunder, under such circumstances, is a special portent in the poets;
Hom. Od. 20. 112-114‚ Virg. G. 1. 487, Aen. 8. 524 foll„ Ov. Fast. 3.
370, etc.

8. currum, Od. 1. 12. 58.

9—11. See on Od. 3. 4. 45. The meaning is ‘all creation.’ The sense
os universality is given by the contrasts3 ἰ631113, though you might
think it too dull and still, the streams which seem as if they moved too
quick‚ the abysses below, the utmost bounds above.’

10. Taenari: a cavern in the cliffs 01 Taenarum Prom. (Cape
Matapan) was thought to be an entrance to Hades, Virg. G. 4. 467
⁶ Taenarias fauces, alta ostia Ditis) Ἄιδα στόμα, Pind. Pyth. 4. 44.

11. Atlanteus finis. Orelli quotes τέρμονες Ἀτλαντικοί, Eur.
Hipp. 3.

14. apicem seems to be used here, and in Od. 3. 21. 30 ‘regum
apices,’ for the tiara of eastern kings. It was the name of the conical
cap worn at Rome by the ‘flamines’3 see Virg. Aen. 8. 664, and
Conington’s note on id. 2. 683. Cicero (Leg. 1. 1) uses it where Livy
(1. 34) uses ‘pileus,' in telling the story of the eagle which snatched
away and restored the cap of Tarquinius Priscus as he approached
Rome. It seems quite possible (as Lord Lytton argues) that even
11 Horace is actually thinking of the vicissitudes 01 Phraates he may
be also ⁶ borrowing a metaphor to describe them from a familiar Roman
myth.’

15. Fortuna, not apparently that he attributes any moral purpose
to F ortune‚ as in the following Ode, or co-ordinates her with ‘deus’
as an expression of the power that governs human lise. It is only
(as in Od. 3. 29. 49 soll. where also we have her ⁴ rushing wings’) the
personification of the vicissitudes of life, the effect that we see, not the
cause which he has traced in the lines before.

16. sustulit. The so—called ‘aoristic⁷ perfect, ‘has often, ere now,
lifted,’ Epp. 1. 2. 47, 1. 19. 48, Virg. G. 2. 211. The reference to
definite past times is more evident when the tense is qualified by the
addition of ⁸ multi‚’ ‘nemo,’ ‘saepe,’ ‘plerumque‚’ (Od. 3. 29. 16), or of
another tense (⁴ rapuit rapietque‚' Od. 2. 13. 20). For the tense of
⁶ posuisse ’ see on 3. 4. 52.
