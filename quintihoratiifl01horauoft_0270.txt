nothing to thee that thou art committing‚⁷ etc. ‘ Negligis committere'
and ⁶ negligis te committere' are both possible constructions.

vengeance will not be unheard.

ODE XXIX.

‘ What, Iccius hankering after the treasures of Arabia, and planning
eastern conquests? Have you chosen already your share of the spoil?
who will say again that aught in nature is impossible, when Iccius the
scholar sells his library to buy armour and belies the promise of his
life ? '

Iccius is unknown to us except from this Ode and Epp. 1. 12. In
that Epistle, written probably about five years afterwards, he has re-
sumed his peaceful pursusts, if he ever left them, and is engaged as
manager of Agrippa⁷s estates in Sicily. &Vc must not take Horace’s
banter here or his imputation of avaricious motives as serious. Some
readers see in the opening lines of the Epistle a hint of restlessness
in Iccius' disposition, but Horace speaks of him as a man of singularly
temperate life and a rare example of the possibility of maintaining a
pure and lofty taste ⁴ inter scabiem et contagia lucri.’

In the year 24 ΒΕ. Aelius Gallus made an unsuccessful expedition
into Arabia Felix. The Ode will probably have been written when the
preparations for it had begun, but these seem to have lasted some time;

Line 1. beatis, properly the epithet of the rich man, not of his riches;
but it contains a iefeience to the name of Arabia Felix.

nune. Dillr. points out the emphasis laid on this word. ‘Whae
now, after a lisetime spent in such different pursuits !’

On the extravagant ideas of the Romans about the wealth and treasures
of Arabia, see Dict. Geog. s. v. Sabaei.

3. Sabaeae, the name of the most important city and tribe of
S. Arabia, the Σαβὰ, ‘ &hebafi of 1 Kings 10. 1.

4. Medo, a hyperbole, possibly of those who vapoured about the
expedition; but it is in Horace's way, cp. Od. 1. 12. 56, 1. 35. 31.
