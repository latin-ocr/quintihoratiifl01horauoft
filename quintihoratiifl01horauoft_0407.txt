NOTES. BOOKIII, ODE XXI. 371

Tunc veniunt risus, tune pauper cornua sumit3
Tunc dolor et curae rugaque frontis abit:

Tunc aperit mentes aevo rarissima nostro
Simplicitas, artes excutiente deo’3

and the fragment of Maecenas' ‘Symposium,’ which Ritter quotes from
Servius on the words ‘faciles oculos ‘ in Virg. Aen. 8. 310: ⁴ Hoc . . .
etiam Maecenas in Symposio cui Vergilius et Horatius interfuerunt, eum
ex persona Messallae de vino loqueretur, ait: idem liumor minis-
trat faciles oculos, pulchriora reddit omnia, et dulcis iuventae reducit
bona?

Line 1. Epod. 13. 6 ‘Tu vina Torquato move Consule pressa meo.’
The date implies that Corvinus is promised not merely old wine (it was
of the vintage of nc. 65, when L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius
Cotta were coss, and therefore must have been at least 35 years old),
but also wine which carried with it personal reminiscences of the poet’s
own life, and which therefore it is a proof of friendship to offer. Cp.
the dating of the Sabine wine which is offered to Maecenas in 1. 20.

2—5. The point of imagining these possible effects of the wine on
different tempers seems to lie in the expression of its potency, ⁶ it must
have some great effect, whatever that be ’; and the stress is really laid
rather on the last of each pair of alternatives ‘ seu . . sive,’ ‘ seu . . seu.’
This is shown by the insertion of ‘pia testa‘ in a place where it is
intended to exert its influenee on the whole stanza, and by the repeti-
tion, after that ‘quocunque nomine' has again reopened the question
of the tendency of the wine, of the commendation ‘ moveri digna bona
die.’

2. querelas; Epod. 11. 18 ‘Querebar . .Simul calentis inverecundus
deus Fervidiore mero arcana promorat loco.' The two pairs seem to be
(1) of talk, the outpouring of passionate complaints or of mirth3 (2)
of feelings, bitterness or passion on the one side, peaceful slumber on
the other.

4. pia testa, ‘gentle wine-jar? The epithet apologises for the
calumnious suppositions; contrast ‘impius clamor‚' 1. 27. 6, and the
tone of 1. 18.

5. quoeunque nomine, ‘to whatever end' (it sums up and repeats
the preceding suppositions) ‘the Massic grapes were gathered whose
juice thou guardest.’ ‘ Nomen ' meant the heading under which an item
was entered in an account, and so seems to have been used for a ‘ ground?
⁶ purpose,' ‘ tendency.’ Tac. Ann. 14. 59 ‘ Decretae eo nomine supplica-
tiones,' ‘on that account’; Cic. de Am. 25 ‘multis nominibus est hoc
vitium notandum,’ ‘on many accounts,’ ‘under many heads.' Bentley
complained that these and similar instances hardly reach (as indeed they
