12. rapidum, ⁶ striding‚' helps the metaphor of ‘fugiente' Horace
probably had in mind Virgil's ‘Te veniente die te decedente canebat‚’
G. 4. 465.

13. ter aevo functus, ‘who lived lise three times over.’ seems (like
Cicero⁷s ‘tertiam [Nestor] iam aetatem hominum vivebat, de Sen. 10)
to be an exaggeration of the Homeric ἤδη δὺο μὲν ’γενεαὶ μερόπων
ἀνθρώπων ἐφθίατο . . μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν, which means only that
the other princes were the grandsons os Nestor's contemporaries. The
old age of Nestor, which needed the support of a son, would have ex· ¹
cused his grief. as would the ⁶ loveable ' character of his son. The story
of Antilochus' death, as he was defending his father, is told in Pind.
Pyth. 6. 28 foll.

15. impubem. His youth is meant to add '‘0, the pathos, ‘Infelix
puer atque impar congressus Achilli‚' Virg. Aen. 1. 479.

16. Troilon. His death does not occur within the period os the
Iliad: it is just mentioned by priam, 11. 24. 257. Virgil (Aen. 1. 474
soll.) makes it the subject os one of the paintings which Aeneas saw in
Dido's hall. ’

Phrygiae sorores. This climax points to the exhortation which
follows: If barbarian women dried their tears, perpetual lamentations
may well be called ⁵ molles ³ in one who may sing of the arms os Rome.

17. desine querelarum, after the model of the Greek genitive with
παύεσθαι, λήγειν; so Virg. Aen. 10. 441 ‘desistere pugnae? Horace
similarly copies the genitive with ἀπέχεσθαι, Od. 2. 27. 69 ‘abstineto
irarum,’ and with φθονεῖν, Sat. 2. 6. 84 ‘ Sepositi ciceris nec longae in-
vidit avenae.’

20. rigidum Niphaten, ‘stiff frozen Niphates? The later Roman
poets took it for a river: Lucan 3. 245 ‘volventem saxa Niphaten ' ; cp.
Juv. 6. 409, Sil. 13. 765 ; and this is perhaps the most natural interpre-
tation of Vi1gil·s metaphor, ⁶ pulsum Niphaten ' (cp. Aen. 11. 405 ‘retro
fugit Aufidus '). The geographers, however, recognize only a mountain
of the name in Armenia.

2 Ι. ‘Medum flumen, the Euphrates. The expressions are very parallel
to Virg. Aen. 8. 726 ‘ Euphrates ibat iam mollior undis: where also the
Geloni and the Armenian Araxes appear.

2 3. intra praescriptum. ‘ within the bounds that we have set them.'

Gelonos, see Introd. to Books i-iii, 1.‘§ 7.

24. exiguis is predicafive, ‘and find them all too marrow?

ODE X.

‘The wise sailor is neither tempted too far out to sea nor frightened
on to rocks and shallows. One who has learnt to love the golden mean
