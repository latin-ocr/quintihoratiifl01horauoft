434 ΗΘΚΛ TJJ CARMJNA.

33. impune, without an effort to resist it.

carpere is not inappropriate‚ as describing the aetion of ¹ obliviones‚'
⁶ wearing away‚' ⁶ obliterating feature after feature’; but it is intended ’
specially to recall the ‘ tooth’ of envy. Od. 4. 3. 16, Epod. 6. 15, Epp.
1. 18. 82, Cic. pro Balb. 26 ‘ maledico dente carpere.'

lividas obliviones; cp. ‘ taciturnitas invida‚’ 4. 8. 23, but it implies ¹
here that if Lollius is forgosten, it will be the result of envious de-

traction.

34 foll. On the general relation of the remainder of the Ode to Lollius'
historical character see Introd.

35, rerum prudens This and the following verse seem to imply
‘the qualities of a commander,’ and to have special though delicate ι
reference to Lollius' military disaster. ‘ Foresight, and a mind not to be
thrown off its balance either by success or temporary sailure?

37. ‘ Quick to punish greed and wrong in others, and proof itself
against the universal temptation.'

abstinens pecuniae, the Greek relative genitive for the Latin
ablative, as ‘ sceleris purus‚⁷ 1. 22. 1.

39. consul non unius anni. Cp. 3. 2. 17 foll. ‘ Virtus repulsae
nescia sordidae Intaminatis fulget honoribus, Nec sumit aut ponit secures
Arbitrio popularis aurae’ 3 see note there. lt is, in a Roman metaphor‚
the Stoic paradox that the wise man is always a king, and it has the π,
inore point that Lollius had actually been consul ;—-‘ not that one year :l
only, but always.' There is no difficulty, so far, in the substantives. 'l
‘ vindex‚' ‘consuL' as applied to ‘ animus,' and not to the man himself; f
no more than in the passage just quoted, where ⁶ virtue’=‘ the virtuous (Ι
inan,’ is said to be always consul. Bentley has collected a number of .
similar instances from all Latinity; ‘ animus lucis contemptor,’ Virg. Aen. ’
9. 205, ‘animus liberator‚' ‘carnifex‚’ ‘proscriptor‚¹ etc. Cp. Sat. 1.
4. 18 ‘ animi. . . raro ac perpauca loquentis.' But the expression be· ᾖ
comes harsh and embarrassed when the mind is said to be a ‘consul of ³¹
more than one year? by virtue of its behaviour as a judge. Ritter thinks '³
that this was sostened by a consciousness in the poet and his readers of ,
the current etymology of ‘consul' as ε ⁴ qui bene consulit,’ Varr. L. L. 5. 80. ·
At any rate the harshness is sostened by the distance of the words from ¹
⁴ animus! With ‘consul ' we take up the notion of Lollius, himself the
ex-consul, and cease to feel that we are speaking of his mind, not of him. ,

40-44. sed quoties . . arma. ‘Sed quoties' answering to ‘ non unius
anni,’ ‘ consul, not of one year, but in perpetuity‚ so osten as,’ etc„
⁸ quoties’ being understood before the second and third clauses. Orelli
compares 3. 24. 40 foll. where ‘si,’ and 4. 8. 31 foll. where ‘sic‚’ are
similarly omitted. Of the Scholiasts Porph. alone takes the stanza in a =

different way, making ‘explicuit . . victor' the apodosis to ‘quoties
