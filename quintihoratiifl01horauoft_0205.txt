NOTES. BOOKI, ODE II. 169

connects the name of Ilia (Rea Sylvia) with the Julian line as virgil
does those of Ilus and Iulus, Aen. 1. 268-288. The Schol. refer to
Ennius sor the story of her being thrown into the Tiber. Claudiam
calls her ⁴ Tiberini uxor.’ Ovid represents her as finding a refuge and
a husband in the Anio.

18. Cp. the opening of Lucan's Pharsalia, esp. v. 10 foll. ‘ Cumque
superba foret Babylon spolianda tropaeis Ausoniis, umbraque erraret
Crassus inulta, Bella geri placuit nullos habitura triumphos ;' see also
Epod. 7. 5-10.

19. Iove non probante. Jupiter, as the Schol. says. ‘terreri voluit
populum, non perire;’ he disapproves the excessive vengeance of llia.
For the division of a word between the third and fourth lines os a
Sapphic stanza, cp. 1. 25. 11 ‘sub inter-lunia ventos 2. 16. 7 ‘neque
purpura ve-nale neque auro.y

21. cives. The purpose for which the sword is sharpened, is indi-
cated partly by the contrasted ‘better' purpose, partly by the emphasis
on ‘cives’; not as soldiers, nor as Romans against foreigners, but as
citizens, in pursuance of an intestine, civil quarrel; see on Od. 1. 52. 5,
and 1. 35. 34. Compare the use of ‘ soror' in Virg. Aen. 12. 871.

22. graveS, Od. 3. 5. 4=‘molesti.'

Persae. From the decline of the Syro—Macedonian kingdom, Rc. 250
foll. to the restoration osa Persian dynasty in the person of Artaxerxes,
the founder of the Sassanidae‚ ΑΛ). 226, the ruling race of western
Asia was the Parthi. a tribe originally settled to the east of Media, and
immediately south of the Caspian. Their kings, the Arsacidae, fixed
their capital at Seleucia on the Tigris, where they adopted the pomp
and title of the old Persian monarchs, βασιλεὺς βασιλέων, βασιλεὺς μέγας.
Horace is the only Augustam writer who calls them ‘Persae' (and
therefore, following the Greek usage, also ⁶ Medi’; see below, v. 51),
an instance probably of the predominant influence of Greek as>ociations
upon his style. Cp. the still more definite identification of the two
dynasties‚ Od. 2. 2. 17 ‘ Redditum Cyri solio Phraaten.'

24· rara, ‘our youth thinned by their parents' crimes? There will
be few to hear the story, for civil war has killed those who should have
bred up sons sor the state; cp. C. S. 17—20,

25. ruentis imperi rebus. The dative: ·' ut rebus succurrat,’
‘rebus,’ ‘the fortunes.’ It is a variety of the more usual ‘ruentibus
rebus,' as Virg. uses ‘ res fractae,‘ Tac. ‘ res labantes.’

2³5. imperi, ‘the empire'=the whole system of Roman rule—the
State in its aspect of power and majesty, 1. 37. 8. Sometimes it con-
tains more dehnitely the idea of the dominion of Rome orer foreign
peopleS, 3. 5. 4, ‘adiectis Britannis Imperio'; cp. the verb in 3. 6. 5
⁴ Dis te minorem quo'd geris imperas [Romane].’ 4. 15. 14 · fama . . et
