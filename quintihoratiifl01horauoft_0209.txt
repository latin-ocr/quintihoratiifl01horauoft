in protestations, seems always to involve a conditi0n; sec Conington‘s
note on Virg. E. 9. 30 ‘Sic tua Cyrneas fugiant examina taxos, . . Iu-
cipe ;' cp. Od. 1. 28. 25. ‘ May you suffer shipwreck if you do not pay
back,' etc. The prayer is illogical, sor if the ship did suffer shipwreck
on the voyage it could not land Virgil safely. But the ship is per-
sonified, and charged by its hopes of happiness to perform a certain
task ; and what happiness can a ship look for but calm seas and favour-
ing winds?

1. potens Cypri, for the gen. ep. Od. 1. 5. 15 ‘potenti maris de0’;
1. 6. 10 ‘ musa lyrae potens.' He is addressing Venus (‘marina‚' Od. 3.
26. 5, 4. 11. 15); she was worshipped at Cnidus under the name of
εὐπλοία, Paus. Ι. 1. 4. Cp. Ov. Her. 19. 160 ‘ Auso Venus ipsa favebit,
Sternet et aequoreas aequore nata vias.'

saw their presence in the electrie lights which are said to play about
the spars of a vessel at times after stormy weather in the Mediterranean,
and which are now called St. Elmo's fire. It is these, and not the
constellation Gemini, that are the ‘ lucida sidera.y Cp. Statius Pro.
Met. Cel. 8 ‘Proferte benigna Sidera, et antennae gemino considite
cornu.’

pater, ‘Aeolus‚' from Hom. Od. 10. 21 3 cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 52.

4. aliiS, ‘all others,' cp. Sat. 1. 10. 77, an uncommon use, but
found even in good prose; ‘vulgus aliud trucidatum,' Liv. 7. 19. 1t

Iapyga, ⁴ albus Iapyx) Od. 3. 27. 20. The N.W. wind, which got
its name in the mouths of those who crossed from Brundusium to
Dyrrhachium, on whom it blew from the ‘ Iapygium Promontorium’ in

Apulia, and to whom it was the most favourable wind. ¹

’ 6. finibus Atticis, ‘ambiguum utrum “ debes finibus Atticis⁷’ an
“ finibus Atticis reddas? ' Porph. It is really governed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, as
grammarians say, by both. This is a construction which Horace often
adopts for the sake of brevity, and to avoid clumsy aud unmanageable
pronouns and particleS. Compare the position of ‘ consiliis' in Od. 2.
11. 11; of‘sibi' in 3. S.19; of ⁶ cantare’ in Sat. 1. 3. 2. The meta-
phor of a ‘ depositum' (Stat. l. c. 5 ‘ Grande tuo rarumque damus,
Neptune, profundo Depositum') is sustained through the words ‘cre-
