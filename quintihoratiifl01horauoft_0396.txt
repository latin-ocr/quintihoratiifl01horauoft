360 HORA Tll CARMHM.

Chloris is warned that she is at once old and poor. ‘ It is time
to give up her wanton ways. What suits her daughter Pholoe does
not suit her. She is the wife of a poor man. Let her take her wool
and spin. That will be more becoming to her than the harp and the
u·ine—cup.'

Metre— Third Asclepz'ad.

Line 3. famosis laboribus, insamous as compared with ‘ lanificium.’

4. maturo, ripe, sor which you are ready.

6. To spoil the look of their company as a cloud does a starry sky.

q. expugnat domos. The editors quote Sen. Nat. Q. 4, praef.
‘ Crispus Passienus saepe dicebat, adulationi nos opponere, non claudere
ostium, et quidem sic quemadmodum opponi amicae solet, quae, si
impulit. grata est, gratior, si effi·egit.'

14. Luceriam, an important town in the interior of Apulia. It is
called ‘ nobilem‚’ as famous for its wool, Plin. H. N. 8. 48. She is to
think now only of getting the best wool. The editors compare an
anonymous epigram, Brunck‚ An. 3, P. 116 ‘H τὸ πρὶν αὐχήσασα πολυ-
χρύσοις ἐπ’ ἐρασταῖς, ‘H Νέμεσιν δεινὴν οὐχὶ κύσασσ. θεάν, Μίσθια νῦν
σπαθὶοις πενιχροῖς πηνίσματα κρούει· Ὀψέ ’γ’ Ἀθηναίη Κύπριν ἔληΐσατο.

16. vetulam. The better MSS. are in favour of ‘ vetula'; the
Comm. Cruq. and one hals of Porph.’s scholium in favour of ‘vetulam,’
‘non decet aetatem tuam in convivio multum potare.' Vetula would be
easily altered by omitting the mark of the m. and the distance of ‘ te ²
would tempt a copyist to assimilatae the adjective to the nearer substan-
tive ‘ faece:

ODE XVI.

‘ Gold is all-powerfuL and powerful for harm. Mythology and history
prove it. And with the grou-th of wealth care grows and the thirst for
greater wealth. Ι take example by you, Maecenas, and shun eminence.
The more we deny ourselves the more the gods give uS. Ι am prouder
and happier in my poor little sarm, its clear stream, its wood, and un—
sailing crops, than the man who owns all Africa. Ι have no superfluous
luxuries, but Ι never feel the pains of penury. Reduced clesires give a
larges revenue than the widest “latifundia’' tho seek much want
much. Happy the man who has, though little, yet enough.'

The Ode is on Horace's common theme, the praise of contentment
and the ‘ aurea rnediocritas ’ of fortune.

Metre—Fourtlz Asclepiad.

Line 2. robustae, probably with Ritter, ‘of oak.² Cp. Ι. 3. 9
⁴ robur et aes triplex.’
