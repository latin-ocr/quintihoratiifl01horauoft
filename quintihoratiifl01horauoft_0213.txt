NOTES. BOOKJ, ODE [V. 177

The Sestius to whom it is addressed is probably identified with
L. Sestius, son of the P. Sestius whom Cicero defended. He had served
in M. Brutus' army with Horace. Dio C. 53. 32 mentions it to the
credit of Augustus, that he appointed Sestius ‘ Consul suffectus¹ in his
own room in ac. 23, although he was notorious for preserving image-S
of Brutus, and honouring his memory.

The Mctre (-›12-cln'l0clzz'1cm IVtum) is from Archilochus, Fr. 91 :-—-

Line 1. solvitur, winter is a chain in which the world is bound.

turrim admovent! The meaning of ‘trahunt‘ is defined by ‘siccas';
‘draw down to the sea the keels long high and dry,' navigation having
been suspended during the winter.

5. Cytherea Venus. The conjunction of the two names is not
found in any other classical writer, cp. Od. 1. 17. 22 ‘Semeleius Thyo-
neus.’ In the procession of the seasons‚ Luci-et. 5. 736, 'Venus is the
companion of Sprfflg, as Ceres of Summer, and ⁴ Exius Evan’ of
Autumn.

due turn and time.

that pleasures and labours begin again with spring.

ardens, ‘ glowing red in the blaze‚’ cp. ‘ rubente dextera,’ Od. 1. 2. 2.

urit, ‘makes them fiery hot.’ The metaphor offended Scaliger,
Bentley, and others. Scaliger conj. ‘urget.’ Mr. Munro makes a strong
case for ‘ visit? the reading of the Paris MS. A, which Bentley preferred,
