may be understood that the girls will pray to Diana for the same
reason. For a similar brachylogy leading to a slight confusion as to
the assignment of the parts of the hymn Ι have already (on v. 3116-

that the horrors oswal· mayssbe felt in Parthian or British, not in
Roman, homes. Cp. Od. 3. 27. 21 ‘ Hostium uxores,’ etc.; Virg. G.
3. 515 ‘ Dii meliora piis erroremque hostibus illum.'

ODE XXII.

‘ Di me tuentur: Dis pietas mea
Et Musa cordi cst.’ Od. 1. 17. 13.

The protection from common dangers accorded to the poet's flocks is
extended to himself. As a child, ⁶ non sine Dis animosus,'11e is covered v
by the wood-pigeons from the snakes and bears of Mount Vultur (Od.
3. 4). Mercury snatches him from the solly and danger of civil war
into which his boyish enthusiasm had carried him (Od. 2. 7). Faunus
(Od. 2. 17) wards off from him the falling tree. Now a wolf flies from
him as he wanders unarmed in the woods near his Sabine farm.

We may compare the Ode with the Epistle (1. 10) addressed to the
same Fuscus, ‘Urbis amatorem Fuscum salvere iubemus Ruris ama-
tores.' ‘ Fuge magna,' v. 52. ‘A har-mless, pious life is the true secret
of safety and of happiness.’ The Ode dresses this doctrine in the garb
of poetry and religion—the Epistle in that of philosophy and worldly
wisdom. Aristius Fuscus is an intimate friend of Horace, Epp. Ι. 10.
2-4 ‘cetera poene gemelli Fraternis animis quicquid negat alter et
alter Annuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi.' He appears in S. 1.
10. 83, amongst the critics by whose judgment Horace will abide, in
S. Ι. 9, as the friend who wickedly escapes, leaving the poet ‘sub
cultro.⁷ He is called by Aer. on Epp. 1. ιο ‘scriptor tragoecliarum‚'
by Porph. ‘ comoediarum,' by both, on S. 1. 9. 61, ‘ grammaticorum doc-
tissimus‚' but nothing is known of him from other sources.
