‘Argivae,‘ which was intended to be antithetical to ‘Dauniae'= ‘Lati-
nae'; see note on v. 28.

26. Xantho. The Lycian, not the Trojan, Xanthus: 3. 4. 62.
Virg. Acn. 4. 143 ‘hibernam Lyciam Xanthique fluenta Deserit.' For
the practice os introducing into prayers the names of the sacred haunts
of the god addressed cp. 1. 30. 1, 3. 26. 10. Apollo's long hair is at
once the sign of his perpetual youth (as in v. 28 ‘levis,’ i. e. ‘imberbis ¹)
and part os the costume osthe bard; see Virg. Aen. 1. 740 ‘crinitus Iopas.'

27. Dauniae, in the first place, doubtless, Horace's own Muse (cp-
3. 3ο. ιο, and ‘ Calabrae Pierides ' of Ennius, 4. 8. 20), as is shown by
the immediate transition to himself, ‘ spiritum Phoebus mihi‚’ etc. But
it is not a purely local designation. Horace would not have said here
‘ Venusinae Camenae? He speaks of ‘Daunian blood’ for Roman or
Italian in Od. 2. 1. 34, and uses the Apulian as the typical repre-
sentative of all Roman virtues (Od. 3. 5. 9. 3. 16. 26, Epod. 2. 42); and
so here the ⁵ Daunian Muse’ is the ‘Italian Muses though he would
remember the special appi‘opriateness of the local name, when the.
chosen representative of Roman poetry is a Daunian born.

28. Agyieu. Ἀγυιεύς was a Greek name os Apollo as guardian of
I streets, ἀγυιαί, Aesch. Agam. 1081, Arist. Vesp. 875. Ritter explains
the choice of the title by the fact that the Carmen Seculare would be
sung ‘ sub dio! This seems far-setched. The associations os the name
t were to Horace, probably, purely literary, and his purpose, as in the
first two lines of the stanza, *is mainly to' make it clear that it is the

ι Greek god in all his attributes whom he claims as the protector of his

 

 

Daunian Muse (the antithesis is present, though we need not in v. 25
read ‘Argivae,’ to make it too obtrusive), · and to this end the tho-
· roughly Greek name contributes Cp. the force of a G1eek form 1.1.

29, 3ο. These vers es form the tiansition to the last part of the Ode.
He has prayed to Phoebus. the Greek god of poetry‚ to defend siom
disgrace, through failure of the poet or performers or audience, the
honour of the Italian Muse. 'Yes‚ it is Phoebus that inspires him;
that teaches him his art3 that gives him the same which has caused
him to be selected for this great task.' Strong in that persuasioni, he
calls on the chorus to obey and learn of him.

31. Carm. Sec. 6. The chorus consisted of boys and girls, all of
patrician honses, and with both parents alive.

33. tutela, passively= ‘qui in tutela Dianae estis' The use is found
in Propertius 4. 8. 3. Diana is the patroness of chastity. Cp. Catull-
34. 1 ‘ Dianae sumus in fide Puellae et pueri integri?
