ODE XX.

¹ Horace 11111 stay no longer on earth; he will mount into the clear
air of heaven and laugh at his detractors. He whom the envious world
despises, but whom Maecenas loves, will not die the common death of
men. Already he feels himselfchanging to a swan. All the world shall
see him and hear his music: funeral rites have no meaning sor him.’

The Ode may be described as an amplification os Ennius' epitaph on
himself:
‘Nemo me lacrymis decoret, neque funera fletu
Faxit. Cur? volito vivus per ora virum?

Compare Virgil's imitation of the same (G. 3. 8):

‘Tentanda via est qua me quoque possim
Tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora.'

The Ode doubtless owes its place at the end of a Book to its general
reference to Horace and his lyric fame; but it does not look as if it
had been written for such a purpose, as Od. 3. 30, Epp. Ι. 20. lts
feeling seems really to lie in w. 4-8.

Line 1. non usitat-a, ‘quia primus Romanae fidicen lyrae,' Orelli.

2. biformis, a poet and yet a swan.

liquidum, ‘clean' opposed to the damp and heavy atmosphere of
earth. Cp. ‘ udam spernit humum‚' 3. 2. 24.

4. invidiaque maior, above the range os envy. It is to attain this
that he will leave the throng of men. For the use of ‘que’ after a
negative clause see on 1. ²7· 16, 2. 12. 9.

5. urbes=the haunts of men.

pauperum sanguis parentum, the very words of the ‘invidi,' as
Sat. 1. 6. 46 ‘Nunc ad me redeo libertino patre natum, Quem rodunt
omnes libertino patre natum.’ ‘Sanguis,' as ‘regius sanguis,’ 3. 27. 653
χ’ sanguis deorun1‚’ 4. 2. 13.
