NOTES. BOOK IV, ODES X, XI. 435

iudex . . praetulit . . reiecit? ‘So osten as on the judgment·seat it resists
the temptations os expediency and bribery, it is a conqueror as much as
isit were scattering soemen in real battle.’ The construction is not any
easier, and the flow of the lines is less easy, than if ‘ sed quoties' gave
at once the full antithesis to ⁵ non unius anni‚' and started us on a fresh
thought; but Porph. seems to be followed, among recent editors, if we
may judge from their punctuation, by Keller and Mr. Munro. The
question is partly mixed up with the further doubt as to the reference of
the whole stanza. Porph.’s construction is only admissible on the view
(which Orelli supports) that it refers entirely to Lollius’ civil life, his
ἵ conduct as a ‘iudex selectus’ (Sat. 1. 4. 123), the last two lines being
η metaphorieal. It must be allowed, however, that under the circumstances
of Lollius, and seeing how tightly his military exploits would in that case
be passed over, it would be a somewhat double-edged compliment to
speak of him as ‘a great conqueror‚’ with the tacit addition of ‘ meta-
phorically and in a moral sense.'

Livy has ⁴ explicare fugam‚' 1. 30.

at once holds it out for Lollius’ own contemplation, and suggests to his
calumniators that such had been Lollius’ real bearing in his province.

ODE X.

‘The day will come, Ligurinus, when your youthful good looks will
pass away, and you will repent that you ever gave yourself such airs on
the strength of them.'

Mene-Second A sclepz'ad.

Line 2. pluma, ‘ down‚' of the first heard. No other instance of the
use is quoted. Dacier understood it as = ‘ penna‚' ‘ when your youthful
pride shall take to itself wings.’ Bentley wished to read ‘ bruma.’

superbiae is the dative with ‘ veniet,’ and probably, as the colloca-
tion shows, also with ⁵ insperata,’ ‘ shall come to thy pride, though it
dreams not of it.'

3. deciderint, i. e. shall have been cut, the sign of manhood.

ODE XI.

‘ My wine is ready, and we are all astir preparing the feast; for it is
the Ides of April, Maecenas' birthday. Come, then, Phyllis, and keep
it with rne; never mind Telephus. What are such ambitious loves to
