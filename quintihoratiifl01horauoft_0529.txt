Canidia is supposed to miss, but in the offering as a palinode a lampoon
more bitter than that which it professes to retract.

40. tu pudiea, tu proba, imitated perhaps srorn the palinode of
Catullus (4²· 24) ‘pudica proba redde codicillos.'

vice, ‘on behalf of.' Orelli and Dills. follow Bentley in preferring
‘vicem,’ the reading which is found in two MSS. of no great age; the
construction, then, as in Plaut. Rud. 3. 5. 34 ‘Vos respondetote istinc
istarum vicem.’

46. obsoleta3 cp. (with Orelli) ‘ Virtus . . neque alienis sordibus obso-
lescit,' Cic⁴ pro Sest. 28 ; ‘ ostattered reputation from the meanness ofyour
parentagc.' Horace uses it elsewhere ofa tumbledown house; Od. 2. 10. 6.

47. prudens, ‘well skilled.' It is perhaps with special reference to
the emphatic ‘pauperum‚’ as the Scholiast suggests5 she shows her
wisdom in choosing graves that were not guarded.

48. novendiales, ‘ninth-day ashes’ seem to mean ‘fresh bur-iedff
These were held fitter for a wizard’s purpose; cp. Ov. Her. 6. 90
⁶ certaque de tepidis colligit ossa 1·ogis‚' etc. The adjective ⁶ novendialis’
properly means ‘continuing for nine days'; and this is the common
meaning of ⁶ novendiale sacrum,’ ‘novendiales feriae,’ ete. But it seems

We. are dependent sor our information chiefly on the Scholiasts upon
this place, upon Virg. Aen. 5. 64, and Terent. I'horm. 1. 1. 16, and they
differ in their accounts of the employment of the intervening days. But
all agree that the ninth day was the one on which the dead was finally
put out of sight.

50. venterz‘partus.' The allusion is to the taunt in Epod. 5. 5.

Pactumeius Orelli shows to have been a Roman name. It occurs
in the consular lists of the first two Christian centur-ies.

52. fortis exsilis, of her speedy recovery. Intended to retract the
retractation.

56, 59. ut . . ut,; Madv. ξ 353 obs. Of something not to be thought
of, whether as improbable or as offensive; Cic. Cat. 1. 9 ‘Quamquam
quid loquor? Te ut ulla res frangat. Tu ut unquam te corrigas? It
more often has an interrogative particle added; as in Hor. Sat. 2. 5. 18
‘ Ut ne tegam spurco Damae latus?'

56. riseris volgata, i. e. ‘volgaveris et riseris.’
