3 1 2 HORA TJJ CARMJNA.

subject, as well as by resemblances of detail, into the same period as
Odes 15, 16, 18 of Book ii, and Ode 24 of this· Book.

Tne chief internal evidences os date are the references in Ode 6 to
lhe still recent Bellum Actiacum (vv. 13-16: cp. 4. 37. 38) and to
Augustus' exercise of the censoriam power (3.0. 23: see Introd. to Od.
2. 15). 'she name of ⁴ Augustus' in 3. 11, if it is held to fix that Ode
afterjanuary‚ Bc. 27, when that title was consen-ed by the senate οη
Octavianus, will still leave it within the general period assigned to the
others.

Lines 1-4. ‘ The crowd of men and women are beyond my teaching:
listen to me, maidens and boys.‘ This idea is partly clothed in the
langunge of a hierophant bidding the uninitiate avannt at the commence-
ment of mysteries. We must not, however, look for the metaphor in
every word of the stanza. It is the epithet ‘ profanum ' that seems first
to suggest it. As the inysteries are ·tho>e of the Muses, the vehicle of
their proclamation will be ‘ carminn.' The audienee are to be ‘virgines
puerique] not because the chorus that sang hymns in honour os a god
(Carni. S. 6) must be so coniposed¹ for this would be to introduce a
second metaphor3 but because it was to the young and simple that the
poet would nddress his precepts of moderate living, of courage, justice
and piety. We seem to have an echo, and an interpretation, of the
imagery of this place in Epp. 1. 19. 32 soll. ‘ Hunc [sc. Alcaeum] ego
non alio dictum prius ore Latinus Volgavi fidicen; iuvat immemorata
ferentem Ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.' Verses 1, 2 con-
tain the two proclamations customary at solemn rites‚ the first to warn
,away improper hearers, ἕκας ‘imm ὅστις ἀλιτρός, Callim. H. in Apoll. 2,
¹· Procul O procul este prosani‚' Virg. Aen. 6. 258; the second enjoining
¹a sacred silence on those that remained‚ Arist. Thesm. 39 εὔφημος πᾶς
’ἔστω λεὰς στόμα συγκλείσας, Tibull. 2. 2. 1 ‘ Dicamus bona verba . .
{Quisquis ades lingua vir mulierque save,' Virg. Aen. 5. 71 ‘ Ore favete

‘omnes' Cp. especially Arist. Ran. 353 soll. Εὐφημεῖν χρὴ κάξίστασθαι
τοῖς ἡμετέροισι χοροῖσιν Ι ὅστις ἄπειρος τοιῶνδε λόγων ἢ γνώμῃ μὴ καθα-
Ιρεύει Ι ἤ ’γενναίων ὄργια Μουσῶν μήτ’ εἶδεν μήτ’ ἐχ ἷρευσεν κ. τ. λ.

2. non prius audita.. The initiated are to receive a new revelation.
'The metaphor‚ if we are to interpret it, would seem to include the two
ideas, that the Odes which follow are to be of a higher mood than
their predecessors, and that the wisdom which they convey is strange
to the age.

3. Musarum sacerdes, a natural description of a poet. Theoc. 16.
29 Μουσάων ἱεροὺς ὑποψῆτας, Yirg. G. 2. 175 ‘ Musae quarum sacra
fero? ’

5. propriQS, each over his oun flock3 i. e. his sway is limited.
