310 ΗΘΚΛ TII CARMJNA.

6. quem vocas dilecte, ‘whom thou callest dear friend? To the
name given him by the envious crowd, he opposes that given him by the
one whose judgment he most values. This is the interpretation of the
Scholiast. Cp. (with Ritter) Maecenas' expression of affection sor
Horace in the epigram preserved in the Suetonian life of the poet: ‘ Ni

te visceribus meis Horati Plus iam dilig0‚' etc. It must be confessed ·

that the separation of ‘ dilecte‘ from ⁴ Maecenas’ is harsh; and such
passages as Ov. Am. 1. 7. 19 ‘ Quis mihi non “ demens,’' quis non mihi
“barbare'’ dixit?‘ hardly reach the boldness of the vocative in this
place. But this seems preferable to the alternative of making ‘vocas ‘
mean ‘ad te vocas.' ln all the passages quoted in which ‘vocare ’ is
really used absolutely in the sense of ⁶ to invite,' it seems to be a collo-
quialism for ‘to ask to dinner,' and Orelli allows that in this meaning
⁴ sententia sane parasito quarn poeta dignior foret.’

8. cohibebor, 2. 14. 9.

9. ‘The skin roughens and shrinks to my legs, as they also shrink
into the legs of a birds Notice the antithetical ‘ asperae . . leves':
see on 1. 36. 16.

11. superne. The e is short, as in Lucr. 6. 543 and 596: see
VVagner's Plaut. Aulul. Introd. p. xxiii.

13. notior, so Keller edits, following the readings of B and A
(though ‘corrected' in the latter by a second hand to ‘otior’). A
large number have ‘ ocior? The hiatus in that case must be defended
hythe same considerations as ‘ periret' in 3. 5. 17; the caesura sepa—
rate's two parts of an asynartete verse. Bentley proposed ‘tutior,’ and
Lachmann follows him, not to avoid the hiatus, but on the ground that
Horace would have felt the bare comparison of his flight to that of
Icarus to be ill-omened, Cp. 4. 2. 2 foll. But it is not here as there
an effort of his genius, which might be unsuccessful, of which he is
speaking. He says that by his poetic fame he will be known to further
regions (or that he will travel faster) than if he had the wings of Icarus.
The fate of Icarus is not in question. ‘Daedaleo,' not a needless
patronymie; but i. q. ‘ ope Daedalea‚’ 4. 2. 2, ‘ Icarus, who had
Daedalus to make wings for him?

14. gementis, 2. 15. 14, 3. 4. 40. The names seem to be selected,
as Dillr. remarks, in stanza 4 as those of strange and barbarous peopleS,
in stanza 5 for distance—east, north, west.

15. canorus aleS. The ‘ white’ (v. 10) and ‘tuneful’ bird is not
named, but is clearly the swan. Cp. 4. 3, 19 ‘ Ο mutis quoque piscibus
Donatura cycni si libeat sonum’; ib. 2. 25 ‘ Dircaeum cycnum '; Virg.
E. . 27.

197. qui dissimulat, fears, though he ‘tries to hide his fear.

19. peritus. Orelli takes this proleptically, ‘ when he learns any·
