NOTES. BOOKIV, ODE II. 403

gentile name alone. Cp. Epp. 1. 10, where the same person is addressed
as ‘Fuscus' in v. 1, ‘Aristius' in v. 44.

ope Daedalea, with ‘ceratis,’ οι· perhaps with the whole ‘ceratis
nititur pennis‚' ‘ he has got some Daedalus to help him.’ Probably, as
Ritter thinks, there is in the expression the idea of the audacity of the
enterprise (‘ Expertus vacuum Daedalus aera Pennis non homini datis '
1. 3. 34), as well as its danger.

3. nititum Virg. Aen. 4. 25² ‘ paribus nitens Cyllenius alis.’

4. nomina, for plural ep. 3. 27. 76. Compare with the stanza the
way in which Horace speaks of the enterprise when it is undertaken by
a friend, not offered to himself, Epp. Ι. 3. 10 [Titius] ‘Pindarici fontis
qui non expalluit haustus Fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos.’

6. quem . . aluere. This seems to be the certain reading, though
the old Bland. is among a sew MSS. which have ‘ cum . . saliere.⁷ The
vulg. was the reading interpreted by Aer. and the Comm. Cruq.

7, 8. ¹ Boils and rushes in a fathomless flood of words.’ As so often
in Horace, the interpretation of the simile is clothed still in language
almost wholly metaphorical and borrowed from the simile itself, see on
Od.1. 35. 19, 2. 2. Ι, 4. 4. 59. ‘Ore ' belongs more to the poet than to
the river, ‘profundo ore ⁷ being the analogue of ‘ ore rotundos A.P. 323,
⁴ magno ore‚‘ Virg. G. 3. 294, of varieties of poetica] style. The epithet‚
on the contrary, belongs primarily to the river, and even ‘ ore’ is a word
which was probably felt to be capable of an interpretation in the same
connection, though neither ‘ fountain—head ' (Virg. Aen. 1. 245) nor
‘ mouth’ (Virg. G. 4. 292) is a meaning which would bear pressing
here.

10. audaces covers, probably, boldness of treatment and of tropes,
besides the two points afterwards named—vocabulary and rhythm.

nova verba, novel words, long compoundS. τῶν δ’ ὀνομάτων τὰ μὲν
διπλᾶ μάλιστα ἁρμόττει τοῖς διθυράμβοις, Arist. Poet. 22. 14.

11. devolvit, as the torrent rolls boulders down its bed.

12. lege solutis, Two technical expressions possibly contribute to
the full force of this phrase: (1) ‘legibus solutus‚' said of any one
exempted from the operation of any law (Cic. Phil. 2. 13), in later times
os the emperor as above the laws (Merivale‚ vol. iii. p. 466) ; (2) ⁵ soluta
oratio,’ the common designation of prose, as exempt from strict laws of
prosody3 so that the words of the text form a sort os oxymoron, ⁴ verse
which is as free of law as if it were not verse?

13. regesque. The kings obviously of mythology—PirithouS, Theseus,
Bellerophon, not the kings of Pindar's day. He is speaking of Hymns
and Paeans. ‘ Que ’ is the reading of all the best MSS„ as against the
vulg. ‘ ve‚’ and the change would hardly be necessary, even if it were
clear that Pindar's Odes on the mythical exploits of demigods were
