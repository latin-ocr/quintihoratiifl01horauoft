buried up to his chin, and left to starve, that his marrow and liver may
be ingredients in a more potent philtre. 41-46, Folia plays her part in
the incantation. what it was is left to our imagination; we are only
told of her power—she could (lraw the moon and stars from the sky.
47—60, Canidia, half afraid already that her spells are not successful,
appeals to the powers that witness her black 3115, 11131 1161 beloved (an
old sop, on whom she is made to pour contempt in her very prayer)
may come to her. 61-82‚ ‘he comes not; what has happened? No
herb has been omitted, nothing that could make him sorget other
charms. Aha! she sees it all. He is under the spell of some more
skilfulwitch. He shall not get off, however. She has a stronger 61131111
yet to try, and heaven and earth shall change places before she lets 1115
love go? 85—102‚ the boy understands her, and interrupts the scene
with a burst of despair, in which he threatens his torturers with the
vengeance of spirits and 111611.

The scene is laid in the interior of a house in Rome, apparently 111
1116 Subura; see on vv. 25, 30, 58. A misunderstanding osv. 43 led
Porph. to lay the scene at Naples.

Line Ι. at, a common particle in exclamations. It implies of course a
previous train of thought of which the speaker is conscious in himself,
or which he imagines in another. The exclamation introduced by it is

‘At tibi pro scelere, exclamat, pro talibus ausis Di‚’ etc„ and cp. the
use of ἀλλά, 6. g. in Aesch. Cho. 306) or of an answer. Here, if with
V and B and Porph. we read ‘regit‘ (the majority of later MSS, have
‘ regis’)‚ the actual address is not to the gods, but to the witcheS, the
first two lines being an exclamation. ⁴ At' introducing the adjurati0n‚

deorum quidqujd; Sat. 1. 6. 1 ‘Lydorum quidquid?

3. et quid. So apparently V, but the other MSS. are fairly divided
between ‘ et ’ and ‘ aut '3 Orelli, preferring ‘ aut‚’ compares Epod. 7. 1.

4. unum contrasts with omnium, ‘so many against one.‘ With
the construction ‘voltus in me ’ cp. Od. 1. 2. 40 ‘ acer Mauri . . cruentum
voltus in hostem}

5. te, singles out Canidia as the principal.

6. veris; cp. Epod. 17. 50. The words are doubtless meant in the
boy's mouth to have an innocent meaning, ‘ if you really know what it
is to be a mother.’

7. purpurae, the ‘toga praetexta'3 ‘sacrum illud praetextarum quo
sacerdotes velantur, quo magistratus, quo infirmitatem puerorum sacram
