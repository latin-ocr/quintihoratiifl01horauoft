NOTES. BOOKJ, ODE XXXVI. 253

or Cretans they used blaek stones as well as white, so that the epithet
would not imply the colonr of the stone to be used.

11. promptae, pred„ the wine jar must be brought out (⁴ cellis de-
promere avitis,' Od. 1. 37. 5), and when brought there must be no
stint of it.

12. Cp. ῐ. 37. 1 ‘pede libero Pulsanda tellus.' The words morem
in Salium occur again in Od. 4. Ι. 28. ‘ Salium ' may be the gen.. as
‘Boeotum,' Ep. 2. 1. 244, or more probably the accus. of the adj.
‘Salius‚' which occurs in Fest.‚ and which Horace (see on Od. 1. 15.
10) would have been likely to prefer to the longer ⁴ Saliaris.' Dancing
was a part of the ceremonies observed by the Salii in the festival os
Mars (Liv. 1. 20), and according to Ovid (Fast. 3. 387 ‘a saltu nomina
ducta ’) was the origin of their name.

13. multi meri, imitated by Ovid‚ Met. 14. 252 ‘multique Elpenora
vini? Cic. ad Fam. 9. 26, describes a man as ‘hospes non multi cibi,
sed multi ioci.' It is an extension of the descriptive gen. ‘pusilli animi.'
etc., Madv. ξ 287, with obs. 3. Bassus, whose usual character is clearly
intended to contrast with that of Damalis in this respect, is on this
occasion to rival her in taking deep draughts of wine, ἀμυστί, i.e. with-
out closing the Πῑουὼεάπνευστί.

14. Bassum. The Roman name almost implies that a real person
is intended. There was a Bassus a poetical friend of Ovid (Trist. 4. 10.
47), and one (or two) contemporary with Cicero; but none is known
to us whose date would well suit this reference. By Martial's time
the name has from this passage become proverbial for a hard drinker
(Mart. 6. 69).

'Plu-emim cp. Callim. Fr. 109 καὶ ’γὰρ ὁ Θρηϊκίην μὲν ἀπέστυγε χάνδον
ἄμυστιν ζωροποτεῖν. Orelli recalls Hector's taunt to Rhesus the Thracian
(Eur. Rhes. 405), οὐκ ἐν δεμνίοις πυκνὴν ἄμυστιν ὡς σὺ δεξιούμενοι. For
the Thracian habits, see on Od. 1. 18. 8.

16. vivax, breve. Merely for the pleasure of the antithesis, cp.
Od. 2. 20. 9, 11 ‘asperae‚ leves.' ‘Breve,’ ‘shortlived‚' as ‘breves
flores rosae,' Od. 2. 18. 13. The flowers are for garlands for the
guestS.

17. putres, ‘melting,' ‘maudlin.'

18. novo, sc. Numida.

19. adultero, ‘adulter vocatur quia veteres amatores ab eo excuti-
untur. Cf. Od. Ι. 33. 9 “turpi Pholoe peccet adultero.” ’ Ritter.

20. Epod. 15. 5, Eur. Hec. 398 ὁποῖα κισσὸς δρυὸς ὅπως τῆσδ’ ἕξομαι,

lascivis, cp. Od. 2. 2. 1—4 for the manner in which the two sides of
the simile overlap. Her motives are attributed to the ivy, as well as
the movements of the ivy to her. See also on 1. 35. 19 ⁴ severus uncus,'
and compare Virg: Aen. 2. 626-630, where the falling tree, which is
