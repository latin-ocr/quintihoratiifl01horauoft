even from luxury to simplet life. It smooths the brow of care. The
dog-days are beginning : in the country they are thinking only of getting
into the shade and to the river—banks. Maecenas is still full of his cares
for home and foreign politics.' Here Horace takes a wider sweep, and
expresses with some dignity his philosophy of lise, such as it is. ‘ The
future is purpose-ly hidden from us. Live in the present; make the best of
it, you cannot control or foresee anything else. This is αὐτάρκεια, and

himself to rob you of that pleasure. Fortune delights in changing men's
outward condition: the philosopher is independent of her. Is his out-
ward happiness is shipwrecked, he can get ashore unharmed himself.’

Line 1. Tyrrhena regum progenies3 see on 1. 1. 1. The corre-
spondence is perhaps not accidental, but intended to help the feeling
that he comes back at the end of his task to the theme with which
he began it——his patron: ‘prima dictus, summa dicendus, Camena?
See Introd. to Books i—iii, ξ 11. 2 note. That Maecenas was proud of
his Tuscan ancestry, and that his friends were in the habit of setting it
in relies against the sels-chosen humility of his rank in Rome, is the

sriend⁷s state and greatness. ‘ My great friend ’ is the natural address,
when the poem is an invitation to him to exchange the weary pomp of
his city life, for the humbler country pleasures of the poet's home. For
the hypallage cp. ‘ Graia victorum manus,’ Epod. 10. 12.

2. verso. The ‘cadus’ or ‘amphora’ had to be tipped to pour its
contents into the ‘ crater' which was set on the table.

4. tuis, ‘expressly for you': in the same way ‘non ante verso lene
merum cado‚’ wine which has not been opened, but left year aster year
to grow mellow, is paired with ‘ tibi ³ 2 it was kept for you, and is good
enough for you.

balanus=‘myrobalanus‚’ Plin. N. H. 12. 46, the Arabian ‘behen

5. iamdudum, antithetical to ‘ morae,' as ⁶ me’ to ‘ te.’ My part is
done long ag03 the delay is on your side.

6. nee. The good MSS. are nearly divided between ‘nec’ and ‘ ne,'
with an odd variant ‘non.' If we have ‘ne' it is final—‘ that you be
not for ever looking etc.' ‘ Nec’ is quite Horatian3 cp. 1. 9. 15, 1. 11. 2,
2. 11. 4, 3. 7. 29. Difficulties have been felt about the present subj.
‘ contempleris’ as contravening the rule laid down by Madvig (ξ 386 ;
