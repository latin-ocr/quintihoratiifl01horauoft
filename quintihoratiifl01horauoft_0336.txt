300 HOA'A ΤΠ CARMJNA.

He has been complaining of his health to Horace, and the poet
would coax him out of his hypochondriacal sears by the expressions
of affection, by the professions of his own strong belief that Maecenas'
life is as good as his own, by recalling his previous recovery from illness
and his flattering reception in the theatre‚ as memories likely to strengthen
his confidence in his destiny and in himself.

The astrological part of the Ode is only an adaptation of the language
osa popular superstition which Horace condemns in Od. 1. 11. Orelli
points out that the language of stanza 5, ‘seu Libra seu,' etc„ forbids
the idea that Horace had confidence in any calculation of his own horo-
scope. He tells us, Sat. 1. 6. 114, that he was fond of standing and
listening to the astrologers of the circus, with the poet's professions of
his resolution not to survive Maecenas cp, Epod. 1; on Maecenas' re-
ception in the theatre, Od. 1. 20; and on Horace's own escape from the
falling nee, Od. 2. 13.

Maecenas actually died in 13.C. 8, a few months before Horace.
