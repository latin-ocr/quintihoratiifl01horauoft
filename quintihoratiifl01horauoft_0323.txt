ODE XIII.

The thoughts suggested by the sall osa tree on his Sabine farm from
which Horace narr-owly escaped. For other allusions to the incident

see Od. 2. 17. ῃ, 3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8; and on the date of all the Odes
which refer to it see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 8.

The poem begins with a burst of indignation, at least half humorous
(cp. Epod. 3), at the'unlueky tree and the wretch that planted it.
Then, from the mention (v. 12) of the accident that had so nearly
overwhelrned him, rises the thought, ‘How little we guess the quarter
from which danger really threatens us. We fix our eyes 011 some one
risk and sear that only, but death comes to all the world from the
quarter they do not expect? Next‚ suggested by the ‘leti Vis rapuit
rapietque,' comes the remembrance how very near to death he has been,
‘how near seeing Proserpine and Aeacus on his seat of judgment and
the separate abode of happy souis, among them' (here comes the last
change) ‘those whom the lyric poet would first look for, Sappho and
Alcaeus. An admiring throng of shades is round both, and the larger
and the more attentive round Alcaeus. What wonder if they listen,

when even Cerberus is spell-bound‚ and Prometheus and Tantalus forget
their pains, and Orion stays from his hunting to hear.'

Line 1. ille et . . primum. The object of Horace's indignation is the
man that planted the tree, so that ‘ille’ stands fitly in the place of
emphasis in both stanzas. ‘ Quicunque primum ‘ has increased force for
its parenthetical position ;—-‘I don’t know who he was or how long
ago it was (the tree had fallen from its age), but I can tell for certain
the character both of the man and of the day of his deed.’ The
alteration to ‘illum' (‘illum et,’ HeinS.; ‘illum o,' Bentley; ‘illum,’
Euam), which makes the whole sentence down to ‘ pagi ’ relative with
‘ quicunque ⁷ sor its subject, ‘ illum ’ only anticipating the next stanni,
really weakens instead of strengthening. There is no MS. authority for
any change.

nefasto, ‘ of ill omen.’ ‘ Nefasti dies ' were properly the opposite of
‘fasti,’ ‘days on which the Praetor did not sit,7 ‘unlawful days.⁷ All
days on which the courts were closed were therefore equally ‘ nefasti ' ;
but by an error which A. Gellius notices (Noct. Att. 4. 9), the epithet
was vulgarly restricted to those which were interdicted sor business as
*tristi omine infames.’ In the poets and post-Aug. prose ‘nefastus’ came
to be used as equivalent to ‘nefarius-‚J as Hor. Od. 1. 35. 35.

2. sacrilega, generalised as osten: ‘ impious.’

3. produxit, ‘reared't-the verb is used of educating children in
