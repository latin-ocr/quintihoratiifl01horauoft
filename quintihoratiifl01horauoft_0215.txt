Line 1. multa in rosa, ‘in rosa' might mean ‘crowned with rose5,’
as Cicero’s ‘potare in rosa‚’ de Fin. 2. 203 perhaps the epithet ‘ multa '
points rather to a ‘ bed of rose leaves.' which can be equally well illus-
trated. Sen- Epp. 36. 9 ‘in rosa iacere'; Arist. Fr. 116 ἐν ἡδυόσμοις
στρώμασι παννυχίζων.

4. cui=‘ cuius in gratiam‚’ ‘ sor whose eye,’ cp. Od. 3. 3. 25.

flavam, Od. 2. 4. 14, 3. 9. 19, 4. 4. 4. The correspondence ot' the
name ⁶ Pyrrha,’ πυρρὰ, ⁶ Golden-hair,⁷ is enough to show, if it were

5. simplex munditiis, ‘plain in thy neatness,' Milton. ‘ Munditiae'
meant a scrupulously exact toilet, not necessarily excluding, but not
requiring, any adventitious adomment. The simplicity of Pyrrha seems
intended to contrast with the lover’s elaborate preparations of himself
and the grot; the ‘liquidi odores‚⁷ ‘ multa rosa‚’ ‘ gratum antium?

fidem, sc. ‘ mutatam.’ Comp. Od. 3. 5. 7 ⁶ Pro curia, inversique
mores? It is an extension of the usage noticed on Od. 1. 2. 1.

6. mutatos deOS‚ the gods as the givers of happiness or pain3 but
from the close connection with ‘ fidem ' there is probably also the feeling
that they are the gods who listened to her vows and seemed to guarantee
s her truth; ὅρκων δὲ φρούδη πίστις, οὐδ’ ἔχω μαθεῖν εἶ θεοὺς νομίζεις τοὺς
τότ’ οὐκ ἄρχειν ἔτι, Eur. Med. 492.

insolens, ‘new to the sight.’

10. vacuam, ‘ free‚' not preoccupied by any other passion, Od. 1. 6. 19,

11 aurae, ‘ignorant how soon the wind may shift? It is a common
metaphor for anything that is fickle and changeable, ⁶ popularis aurae‚'
Od. 3. 2. 20.
