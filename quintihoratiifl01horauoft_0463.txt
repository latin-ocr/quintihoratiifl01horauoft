ODE VIII.

‘Under other circumstances, Censorinus, I would send my friends
bronzes and pieturcs, and you should have the best of them. As it is
1 have none to give, and you would not care for them. Verse you will
value and verse I can givc; and hear now the value I set on the gift.
statues and inscriptions, the great feats of the Punic wars, do not
throw such lustre on generals like the Scipios, as do the verses of
Ennius. Would father Romulus have lived without a grateful posterity
to tell of him? Would Aeacus have won the happy islands but for
Pindar's Muse? The Muse gives immortality, and instals her favourites
in a place in heaven3 witness Hercules, the Tyndaridae, Bacchus
himself.'

C. Marcius Censorinus was consul in mc. 8, and died, amid general
regret, A.D. 2. Vell. Paterculus calls him ‘vir demerendis hominibus
natus.'

Metre——Fz'rst Asclepiad.

Line 1. donarem. This reference is to the custom of exchanging
presents (‘strenae ') on certain occasions, such as the Calends of March
or the Saturnalia. Cp. the Pseudo-Tibull. 3. 1. 1 ‘ Martis Romani
festae venere Kalendae . . Et vaga nunc certa discurrunt undique pompa
Perque vias urbis munera perque domos,² and read Stat. Silv. 4. 9. The
condition is expressed partly in v. 5 ‘divite me,' etc.⁷ the construction
having been in the meantime changed, so that the subject of ‘donarem’
appears in the abl. absol.; partly in the words ‘grata commodus,'
which answer to one another, ‘grata ’ meaning ¹ pleasing to their taste,‘
‘commodus’ (cp. Epp. 2. 1. 227, A. P. 257) ‘consulting their taste.'
⁴ I would give . . if I had them, and my friends cased sor them.'

2. aera, works in bronze, such as vases.

3. tripodas; see Dict. Ant. s. v.

fortium Graiorum, in reference to such passages as Hom. 11. 23.
259, 264, etc. (cp, Virg. Aen. 5. 110, 9. 265), and to the use of a
tripod as a prize at the Pythian and other games; Herod. 1. 144.

5. ferres, ⁶ acciperes,' sc. ‘ a me;’ Od. 3. 16. 22, Sat. 2. 1. 12, Epp.
2. 2. 14.

scincet emphasizes the condition, the stubbornness of the ‘ if.' ‘All
this would happen supposz'ng⁵ you mark me, I were rich,' etc.

artium, ‘works of art‘3 Epp. 1. 6. 17, 2. 1. 203. It goes somewhat
beyond Virgil's use, ‘ clipeum . . Didymaonis artes,’ Aen. 5. 359, which
is after such expressions as Soph. O. C. 412 κρατῆρες .- . ἀνδρὸς εὕχειρος
