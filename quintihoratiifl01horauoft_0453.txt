NOTES. BOOKJV, ODE JV. 417

victis: seu victus est instaurat cum victoribus certamen‚' and by Justin.
31. 6 ‘cum Romano scu occupaveris prior aliqua seu viceris tamen etiam
cum vieto et iacente luctandum esse.'

evenit, so all the good MSS. ‘Exiet‚' which Orelli accepts, from
very little MS. authority, in order to harmonize with ‘proruet’ and
‘ geret,‘ is a form of the future unparalleled in any classical writer. There
is more MS. authority for convertiug the other verbs into presents;
but this only shows that the differcnce of tense was felt as a diffi-
culty. '

66. multa cum laude, ‘ amid lond applause‚' of a feat in a wrestling
match. It is also taken with ‘ integrum‚’ ‘ with all his laurels.'

integrum, ‘sresh‚’ ‘with all his powers unbroken.' We have to un-
derstand from ‘integrum victorem ⁷ that the subject os the sentence, on
the contrary, ,has just been thrown.

68. coniugibus loquenda.. It is hard to say whether this is to bc
taken, with Orelli, of their own wives, ¹ for their wives to tell os,' i.e. in
pride3 or, with Ritter‚ os the Carthaginians‘ wives, ‘which only wives
will live to tell of,' the husbands being all slain. The latter gives a
more definite climax to the stanza; but it must be allowed that if this
is the meaning, we should have expected some word to imply either
that the ⁴ wives ’ would be widows, or that their ⁴ talk ’ would be by way
of mourning. Catullus puts the idea more distinctly, ‘Illius egregia<
virtutes claraque faeta Saepe fatebuntur gnatorum in funere matres,’ 64.

69. iam non . . superbOS, as after Cannae. Cp. Livy's account of
Mago's mission to Carthage to announce that victory, and carry the
proof of itin three bushels of gold rings taken from Roman knights,
23. 1 2.

72. Hasdrubale interempto; Liv. 28. 12.

75—76. It is a question whether the stanza is a continuation of Han-
nibal's speech or the poet's summing up. The latter seems more likely.
A quiet ending of the Ode is part of Horace's art (see Introd. to Books
i-iii, ξ 11. 3), but he would hardly put into Hannibal's mouth a (11111
prophecy of the glories of the house of Nero. It is pretty certain, also. Α
that Ritter is right in supposing that the ‘curae sagaces’ belong to
Augustus. Cp. 4. 14. 16 and 32 ‘ Te copias, te consilium et tuos Prae-
bente Divos? Horace’s intention is to unite the praises of the emperor
with those of the young Netos. Here the compliment is intensified by
the conjunction of his protection and that of Jupiter. This is the only
interpretation which will give the last line and a half sufficient weight
to balance the line and a half which precede.

73. perficiunt. This was the reading of Bland. Vet.‚ though most
other good MSS. have ‘perficient.’ When once the stanza was taken
