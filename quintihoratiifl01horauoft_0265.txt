NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXVIII. 229

lines, and appealing to a passing sailor in the remainder. The com-
moner view makes it a dialogue begun by the sailor who finds the body
os the philosopher, and moralizes upon it till he is interrupted hythe
shade of Archytas. Where the break takes place is a question still to
be settled. Verses 7, 15, 17, and 21, have all been proposed. A chief
motive sor throwing the division as late at least as v. 15, is to prevent
the appeal of v. 14 ‘Iudice te non sordidus auctor Naturae verique’
from being addressed by Archytas to the sailor. Newman, on the con—
trary, hears in the appeal so addressed a very keynote of the Ode. He
thinks that ‘the poem is written in the spirit of Lucian to ridicule
the mixture os old mythology and new philosophy in Southern Italy,
where the Pythagorean doctrines were widely diffused. The sailor is
presumed, by the shade of Archytas, to be an adherent os Pythago1·as.'

Dillenburger, dividing at v. 17, thinks that the point of the Ode is
the mutual exposure by a philosopher and a man of the world of the
vanity of their respective pursuits,—the philosopher measuring the sand
and dreaming of metempsychosis, the trader so intent on his pursuit
of gain as to be unwilling to spare a minute to render the last service
to his brother mam—both losing sight of death, and of their common
humanity. The chief difficulty in the way of this interpretation is sup-
posed to lie in the rendering of vv. 2, 3. Can ‘parva munera pulveris
te cohibent ’ mean ‘the want of the gift of a little dust keeps you fast ³ ἶ)
Or has Horace, when he makes Archytas ask for burial in v. 23, for-
gotten that he had already buried him in v. 2? Perhaps we may say
that neither Horace nor Archytas vouches for the fact of a due sprinkling
of dust. They are the sailor's words; and he is thinking at the time
of the small compass to which the sar—reaching mind of the philosopher
is shrunk, not of the sufficiency or insufficiency of his burial. Archytas
replies that his case is worse even than the sailor had supposed, for he
still lacks the sand that would give his shade rest.

Those interpreters who, for this or other reasons, hold that the un-
buried body is of some other than Archytas, explain the address of the
early lines by placing the scene of the Ode in sight of Archytas' tomb.
There is stilla question whether it is a dialogue or a monologue. The
interpretation which Orelli gives from an anonymous friend, and which
he favours himself, makes the contrast between vv. 1—20‚ which contain
reflections on the common doom of mortality suggested to a passing
voyager by the sight of the philosopher's tomb‚ and the remainder of
the Ode, in which the voice of an unburied corpse on the shore is sup·
posed to interrupt his moralizing, and in its urgent appeal to suggest
that, after all, death is not the hardest of sates.

Ritter imagines the Ode to have been suggested by the drowning
of some ‘doctus iuvenis’ which was the talk of Tarentum on some
