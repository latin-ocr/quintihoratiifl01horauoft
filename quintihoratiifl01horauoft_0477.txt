25. 19. The oak is chosen as a long-lived tree.

10. et, as Dillr. points out, has a consecutive force, and shows the
application of the metaphor ‘ and so '3 cp. 1. 3. 8, 2. 2. 10.

te . . te. ‘Te' in both cases has to do double duty, as the object
both of ‘ refugit’ and of ‘ turpant.’

12. capit-is nives. Quintil. 8. 6. 17, gives this as an instance of a
harsh metaphor: ⁴ (lura id est a longinqua similitudine ducta translatio.’
He is speaking of oratory rather than poetry, and the metaphor has a
special appropriateness here, as giving another image of winter; but, as
Macleane observes, it is sufficiently obvious to be current in all languages.

13. Coae purpurae; Sat. 1. 2. 102; see Paley’s note on Prop. 1.
2. 2. A much—valued silk, of light gauzy texture, from the looms of Cos,
one of the Sporades just S. W. of Halicarnassus. It is now called
Stanchio‚ a corruption, it is said, of ἐς τὰν Κῶ, as Stamboul of ἐς τὰν
πόλιν.

14. cari, ‘ precious‚' ‘costly’3 Ov. A. A. 3. 129 ‘Vos quoque non
caris aures onerate lapillis? This is the reading osv and Aer„ who
interprets ‘gemmarum pretiis! Some good MSS. have‘ clari.'

15. notis condita fastis inclusit. The 11 ords comey a double
notion: the years which are gone are stored safely where they cannot be
got back again, and where all can read the record of their number.

21. ‘Who reigned in Cinara's stead, a fair, fair face, queen of sweet
arts‚’ Conington. ‘Felix'zpcinaapa‚ ‘quam ut divam ac dominam sus-
piciebam.’ For Cinara see Appendix Ι. ‘Post Cinaram' may only
mean ‘aster,' in order of precedence, as ‘post Chloen‚’ 3. 9. 6. Bentley
was the first to take ‘nota artium gratarum’ together, on the analogy
of ‘notus in fratres animi paterni‚' 2. 2. 6, ‘et’ being=‘etiam.' It
must be allowed that the particle is hardly needed. If we separate
‘nota’ from ‘artium‚‘ it must be taken more closely with ‘felix post
Cinaram’3 they will combine the ‘Persarum rege beatior' and ‘Romana
clarior Ilia' of 3. 9. 4, 8. In any case ‘felix’ agrees with ‘quae,' sc.
‘Lyce‚' not with ‘facies' which is only substituted for it in the last
clause. Cp. Epod. 5. 73 ⁴Vare . . O inulta fleturum caput' with ‘artium
facies ' ; isit be so taken, cp. 4. Ι. 15 ‘ centiun puer artium.’ The ‘ artes'

totius denique eorporis 'motu placet?
