man who first ventured upon it. The gods meant it to be a barrier'
impassable, but man (lelights in disobedience. Prometheus brought
sire on earth and sickness with it. Daedalus tried to fly. Acheron was
no barrier to Hercules. VVhere shall we stop? and when will Jove be
able to lay aside his bolts of wrath?'

This Ode has been very generally referred to the voyage of virgil to
Athens, from which he returned only to die in B.C. 19. This, however,
would fix its composition four years later than the (late which the con-
siderations suggested by Od. 1. 12 lead us to assign to the publication
of Books i iii; nor is it an Ode which seems very likely to have been
inserted after publication. Given to the world in Virgil' 5 1116111116, it
seems playful and affectionate, but it would seem cold and irrelevant to
be published aster his early death, and in a volurne in which it was the
sole record of their friends-bip. Frauke felt the difficulty so much that
he proposed to read ‘Quintilium' sor ‘ Virgilium‚‘ thinking that he
could trace a correspondence between this Ode and 1. 24, especially in
1·. 11 ‘ heu non ita cre(litum.’ It has even been suggested that it may
have been another Virgilius, as is the case probably with Od. 4. 1².
The simplest solution would be that the reference is to another voyage.
All we know even of the voyage in 13.6. 19 is due to the fragmentary
biography which goes by the name of Donatus, and which is not sup-
posed to be earlier than the fifth century.

For other notices of Horace's friendship for Virgil, cp. Sat. 1. 5. 40,
6. 55. The form of the Ode may have been suggested by a poem of
Callimachus, the beginning of which' 15 preserved: ——

ἀ ναῦς ἂ τὸ μόνον φέγγος ἐμὸν τὸ ’γλυκὺ τᾶς §offis
ἅρπαξας, ποτί τυ Ζᾶνος ἱκνεῦμαι λιμενοσκόπω.

Statius' ‘Propempticon Metio Celeri‚' Sylv. 3. 2, is in great part an
expansion of Horace’s poem. We may contrast Horace’s wishes for
the voyage osan enemy, Epod. 10.

The tirade against sea—travelling as one form os man’s restless audacity
is in part playful; and as Prof. Sellar (Roman Poets of the Augustan
Age, p. 120) suggests, adapted to Virgil’s own temperament and ex-
pressed feeliugs: but Horace recurs to the idea that commerce and the
mingling of nations are against nature and a source of evil, and that if
the golden age could return they would cease; Od. 3. 24. 36-413 Epod.
16. 57-62. Cp. Virg. E. 4. 32-393 and Hesiod ἔργα καὶ ἡμέραι 236.
