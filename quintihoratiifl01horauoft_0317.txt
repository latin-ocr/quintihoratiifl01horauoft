NOTES. BOOKII, ODE X. 281

neither has a hovel with a roos falling in nor a palace that would attract
the evil eye. The higher the seat the greater the sall. The wisc man is
prepared sor fortune to change like everything else. Be brave and hopcsul
if things are against you, and so, too, do not spread all your sails because

the wind chauces to be favourable.'

Horace recommends moderation of lise and mannerS. Professedly
it is a mean that he praises ; but it is clear throughout that it is excess
that he deprecates; the danger of defect is not really before his mind.
This is shown in thefirst part of the Ode by omission—the hypothesis
would require a stanza corresponding to st. 3 to illustrate the danger os
being too low, as that illustrates the danger of being too high‚—in the
second part by the stress laid on the alternative least contemplated‚ under
cover of which the poet at last ventures to put plainly the lesson on
which his heart is really set.

The person to whom the Ode is addressed is the same as the ‘ augur
Murena' of Od. 3. 19. 11 (see also Sat. 1. 5. 38). He is variously called
‘ Lucius Murena ‘ (Vell. Pat. 2. 91), ‘ Licinius Murena ’ (Dio Cass. 54. 3),
‘ Varro Murena' (Suet. Tib. 85, and he is said by Dio (l. c.) to have been
the brother of Terentia, the wife of Maecenas. There is one of Cicero's
friends who is called A. Varro (ad Fam. 16. 12, see note in XVatson's
Select Letters, p. 305) and Varro Murena (ad Fam. 13. 22). The friend
of Horace has been sometimes identified with the friend of Cicero, some—
times taken to be his son. The double set of names must imply that
their bearer, or, if there were two, the elder bearer of them, had passed
by adoption from one ⁶ gens‘ to the other.

The ‘ Murena ⁹ of Horace had been employed by Augustus in B.c. 25,
in the subjugation of the Salassi, the inhabitants of the Val d'Aosta, and
had been named as Consul Suffectus in 23. In 22 he was accused, εἴτ’
οὖν ἀληθῶς εἴτε καῖ ἐκ διαβολῆς (Dio 54. 35, of a conspiracy with Fannius
Caepio, and, in spite of the efforts of ‘ Proculeius, his brother (see on
Od. 2. 2. 5), and Maecenas, his brother-in—law' gDio l. c.)‚ was put to
death. In the character given os him (ἀκράτῳ καῖ κατακορεΐ παρρησίᾳ
πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως ἐχρῆτο, see Dio l. e.‚ who tells a story of his boldness
of speech towards Augustus himself) we may probably see the appro-
priateness of Horaee‘s persuasive to moderation.
