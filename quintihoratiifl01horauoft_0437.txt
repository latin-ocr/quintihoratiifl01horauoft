NOTES. BOOKIV, ODEI. 401

15. eentum artium, the descriptive genitive; Madv. ξ 287, with
obs. 3. It seems to have been almost a proverbial expression. ‘ Omnium
artium puerulos,' Cic. Rosc. Am. 41.

, 17. quandoque, usually=‘aliquando '; bnt Horace uses it as=

‘quandocunque' Cp. Od. 4. 2. 34, Α. Ρ. 350.

potentior seems to some degree to continue the metaph. of ‘militiae
tuae? ‘ So soon as he shall laugh triumphant over the presents of his
open-handed rival.' His rival can give richer presents; Paulus fights
and vanquishes him with arms which Venus lends him—beauty‚ youth,
etc. ‘ Muneribus' is the ablative ofcornparison after ‘ potentior.’

19. Albanos . . lacus where Paulus, it is implied, had a villa. The
title includes the Lago d' Albano and the Lago di Nemi.

20. ponet marmoream; cp. Sat. 2. 3. 183 ‘aeneus ut stes,‘ and the
· promise in Virg. E. 7. 31 ‘Si proprium hoc fuerit levi de marmore tota
. . stabis? χαλκοῦν τινὰ ἱστάναι is a common expression in Demosth., as
Fals. Leg. 425. 1.

citrea. The reading ‘ Cypria,' found in a few good MSS„ seems to
be due to the copyist's reminiscence of Od. 1. 1. 13, where the con-
nection is wholly different. The ‘ citrus ' is mentioned by Pliny (N. H.
13. 16) as much used in temples on account of the durability of the
wood. What it was is not so certain; apparently some kind of cypress
or cedar; certainly different from the citron, the ‘ Medicum malum' of
Virg. G. 2. 126.

22. It is difficult to be certain about either the reading or the exact
meaning. A majority of the older MSS. have ‘lyrae,' ‘ tibiae,’ but the
Bland. Vet. is among those which read ‘lyra,’ ‘ tibia? In that case they
are ablatives, constructed probably with ⁴ delectabere,' though they may
also be taken after ⁴ mixtis.' Against the ablative, there is the unplea-
santness‚ to our ears at least, of four verses out of five ending with a long
‘a.' If we read ‘ae,' there is still a question both of construction and
sense. Are ‘ lyrae,' ‘ tibiae’ genitives after ‘ carminibus‚' ‘ mingled
strains of harp and flute '3 or datives, as Orelli thinks, after ‘mixtis '?
And in this last case does ‘ carminibus ' mean the joint strains mingled‚
as we should rather say ‘of' than ‘with' the harp and flute‚ or are
‘ carmina ' the voices of singers to be added to the instrumental music?
More probably, perhaps, the former, as he is speaking now of the music
at a sacrifice (Od. 1. 36. 1); the hymns of praise are mentioned in the
next line. For the ‘lyra' and ‘tibia’ see on Od. ¹: 1. 32, 1. 12. 1,
3. 4. 1, Epod. 9. 5. 6.

24. fistula is the Gr. σύριγξ or Pan's pipe.

25. bis die, morning and evening.

28. in morem Salium; see on 1. 36. 12.

ter; see on 3. 18. 16.
