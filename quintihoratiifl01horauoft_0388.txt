of its dull expansion of the idea of ‘immanis ianitor aulae,‘ and specially
on account of the unemphatic use of ‘eius,’ of which Bentley had
previously complained. This is found in Ovid (Trist. 3. 4. 27), and in
Horace's Satires (2. 1.. 70, 2. 6. 76). In the only other instance of the
word in the Odes (4. 8. 18), it is strongly demonstrative. Virgil does
not use it at all. The expansion, however, is (as Jahn points out) quite
in Horace's way (cp. 1. 12. 26-32‚ 2. 4. 9—12, 3. 4. 61-64‚ C. S. 41—44)‚
and the details of horror all make it a stronger instance of the power of
music. The principle os interpolation, early enough to vitiate the MSS.
before the time of the Scholiasts, cannot be argued on a single case.
On the general question see Mr. Munro's remarks in the Introduction
to Mr. King's edition, p. xiv. Bentley would remove part of the diffi-
culty by reading for ‘ eius atque ' ‘ exeatque.'

20. ore ‘erilingun see on 2. 13. 34 and 2. 19. 31.

21. Tityosque ; see on 2. 14. S. For the singular verb ‘ risit’ see on
1. 3. 10.

22. invito, ἀγελάστῳ, it was not naturally inclined to smiles,

26. inane . . pereuntis, answering to one another, ‘empty‚ because
the water always ran away! For the genitive see Madv. ξ 290 e, note.

25. dolium is the vessel full of holes which it is their hopeless task
to fill. ‘ Urna‚' in v. 22, is the smaller pitcher with which each draws
water for the purpose.

pereuntis has both the original meaning of ‘flowing through,' and
also the common meaning of ‘ vanishing,' ⁵ being wasted? There is the
same double sense in Lucr. 1. 2 50 ‘pereunt imbres’; 262 ‘non igitur
penitus pereunt.'

28. sera, ὑστερόποινα.

30. nam quid, etc. He justifies the exclamation ‘ impiae,' and then
repeats it.

potuere, repeated with a play on the double sense of ‘ posse‚’ to be
able in respect of physical power, and to be able in respect of heart and
will; the ᾗῐεῒεέδυνήθησαν, the second εέτλησαν. For the second sense
cp. Epod. 9. 14 ‘miles spadonibus Servire rugosis potest.'

31. duro. For the meaning of the epithet cp. v. 45 ¹ saevis catenis:
and see on Epod. 5. 30, Od. 4. 4. 57.

34. periurum, because he had betrothed his daughters to the sons of
his brother Aegyptus, and now bade them slay each her bridegroom.

3 5. splendide mendax, an oxymoron already familiar to poetry and
poetical rhetoric. Aesch, Fr. 275 ἀπάτης δικαίας οὐκ ἀποστατεῖ, Soph.
Ant. 74 ὅσια πανουργήσασα, Eur. Bacch. 334 καταψεύδου καλῶς, Cic. pro
Mil. 27 ‘mentiri gloriose.’

40. fane, *λάθε, decipe fugiendo,' Schol. Cp. Epp. 1. 5. 31 ‘postico
falle clientem! ’
