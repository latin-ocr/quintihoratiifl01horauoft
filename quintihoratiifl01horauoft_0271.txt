NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXIX. 235

in the expedition is spoken of. It is he that plans the war, that
carries chains ready made for his captives (as Florus, 3. 7, relates that
M. Antonius, the father of the Triumvir, did when he attacked Crete) ε
he is to have the pick of the spoil, his Briseis like Achilles, a court
page as his cup-bearer.

5. quae virginum barbara, for ‘quae virgo barbara' or ‘quae
virginum barbararum! Horace is fond of variations of the kind; cp.
Epod. 10. 13 ‘ Graia victorum manus ⁷3 Sat. 2. 1. 61 ⁵ majorum nequis
amicus? He is speaking of a princess, the ‘bellantis tyranni adulta
virgo' of Od. 3. 2. 7.

7. puer ex aula, ‘a page from the court'; Liv. 45. 6 ‘pueri regii
apud Macedonas vocabantur principum liberi ad ministerium regis
electi.’ The phrase ‘ ad cyathum stare' occurs in Suet. Jul. 49. Com-
pare Virro's cup-bearer‚ ‘Flos Asiae,’ Juv. 5. 56, and the *incultus puer
. . non Phryx aut Lycius’ of a humbler household, id. 11. 146.

9. doetus, etc„ i. e. ‘a high-bom boy,⁷ an archer like his fathers
before him. The purpose is to exalt the value of the page, not, as
some editors think, to frighten Iccius.

sagittas tendere. Virgil has the same inversion, ‘spicula tendere
cornu,’ Aen. 9. 606.

Sericas. This illustrates the ‘ Mede’ or Parthian of v. 4: it is the
whole East that Iccius is going to conquer: see on Od. 1. 12. 56.

10. arduis montibus. It may be doubted whether this is a dative
case like Od. 1. 24, 18, or an abl. absol. on the analogy of ‘adverso,
secundO, flumine‚’ ‘up the steep mountains’ side.⁷ Notice the anti-
thetical position of the two adjectives ζ arduis pronos.' Eur. Med. 410
ἅνω ποταμῶν ἱερῶν χωροῦσι παγαί, καὶ δίκα καὶ πάντα πάλιν στρέφεται.

13. nobilis, The MSS. are fairly divided between ‘nobilis’ and
‘nobiles‚' but it must be remembered that ‘nobilis' may still be the
accusative plural. The arrangement of the words is in favour of the
genitive, as pairing, aster Horace's way, the substantives and epithets.
In support of the genitive are quoted Epp. Ι. 19. 39 ‘ nobilium scrip-
torum ’; Cic. Phil. 5. 5 ⁴ Phaedri philosophi nobilis.' In support of the
accusative, A. P. 258 ‘ Acci nobilibus trimetris ⁷; Mart. 7. 97. 8 ‘ Turni
. . nobilibus libellis'; and A. Gell. 13. 27 ‘Panaetii tribus illis inclytis
libris?

14. Panaeti, the Stoic philosopher and the friend of Scipio Africanus
Minor. His great work was a treatise περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, which was
the basis of Cicero's de Officiis.

Socraticam domum, A. P. 310 ⁵ Socraticae chartae‚' the writings of
Plato, Xenophon, etc. ‘Domus’ is used for a school of philosophy by
Sen. Epp. 29. ⁴1dem hoe omnes tibi ex omni domo acclamabunt,
Peripatetici, Academici, Stoici, Cynici.’ Cp. Cicero's phrase, de Div. 2.
