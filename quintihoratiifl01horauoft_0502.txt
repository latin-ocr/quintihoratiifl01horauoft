466 HORATJJ EPODON LIBER.

10. liberrima3 Epod. 11. 16 ‘libera bilis‚' ‘finding free vent.’ The·
remaining verses represent the actual expression of the indignation.
This is clear, as Ritter points out, from the change from the second
person to the third.

11. triumviralibus3 Dict. Ant. s. v. ‘Triumviri capitales.' They
had the power of inflicting summary punishment upon slaves.

12. praeconis ad fastidium, ‘till the crier was tired.' What part
the crier played in the chastisement does not appear. The editors say
that he had to go on proclaiming the culprit's offence, but they allege
no adequate authority. Porph.'s note is ‘donec . . praeco cum vellet
desinere iuberet.’

13. Falerni, some of the best land in Campania. The Scholiasts
remark that in Italy the vines are trained on trees, and the ground
between them ploughed and sowu. The Appian way is perhaps named
as the road which he would naturally trax-erse on his way between
Rome and his estate.

15. ‘ Sits grandly as a knight in the front seats, and snaps his fingers
at Otho? He has no sear of a prosecution under Otho’s law sor taking
a seat in the sourteen rows reserved sor the ‘equites' and persons
‘equestri censu,' for he is possessed of far more than the requisite

income of 400.000 sesterces; cp. Epp. 1. 1. 58, 62. For other references ¹

to this law of L. Roscius Otho see Cic. Mur. 19, Juv. 3. 159, 14. 324.
It would seem from the allusion here, as well as from other considera-
tions‚ that the purpose of the law was exclusive and aristocratic.

17. quid attinet, ‘what good is it?' No exact parallel can be

quoted for ‘ ora navium rostrata ' π ‘ ships with their beaked bows' ; but “’

we need hardly alter it with Bentley sor that reason to ‘ aera? Perhaps
we may compare Homer’s νῆες μιλτοπάρῃοι, and Aeschylus’ converse
use of πρώρα and xaAAlarpoepos, of the human face.

18. duci seems to imply that an expedition was at that time fitting ³

out against Sextus Pompeius and his ‘gang of brigands and slaves';
cp. Epod. 9. 9, 10.

EPODE V.

Canidia, with her crew of witches‚ Sagana, Veia, and Folia, is

engaged in the task of drawing to her, by spells of magio, a miserable
old man named Varus. vv. 1-10‚ the poem opens with the terrified
prayers of a boy, who sees dimly that the hags have some dreadsul
intent, though he knows not what. 11—14, he is stripped and set in the
midst to await their further purposes. 15—24, Canidia gives her orders
for the brewing of the magio bowl. 25—28, Sagana spriukles the house
with water from Avernus. 29—40, Veia, meanwhile, is digging in the
garden a hole where, if this spell proves insufficient‚ the boy is to be
