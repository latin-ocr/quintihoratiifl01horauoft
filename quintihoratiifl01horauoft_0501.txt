NOTES. EPODE IV. 465

the Roman populace as is implicd by vv. 1 1-16. The office of‘ tribunus
militum ’ seems also a strange one to be selected (Horace would choose
the highest that he filled) sor the commander of a fleet. Several MSS„
including B and A, head the Epode with the words ⁴ Ad Sextum Menam
libertinum. Vedium Rufum ex servitute miratur usurpasse equestrem
dignitatem usque ad tribunatum militum‚' with no sign that the two in-
scriptions are inconsistent or alternative3 a common mistake‚ which
seems to lead us back to some common authority of greater antiquity.
Of the two names offered, Menas was a likely guess to any one who
knew the history of the time, and therefore carries with it less proba-
bility than the entirely unknown name of Vedius Rufus, to which there
was nothing in the text or in the generally known histories to lead a
copyist or annotator. Orelli shows from an inscription that Rufus is
sound among the cognomina of the Vedii.

Line Ι. Epod. 15. 7, a proverb for implacable hate3 Hom. Il. 22. 263
Οὐδὲ λύκοι τε καὶ ἄρνες ὁμόφρονα θυμὸν ἔχουσιν, Ἀλλὰ κακὰ φρονέουσι
διαμπερὲς ἀλλήλοισιν ζὮς οὐκ ἔστ’ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ φιλήμεναι.

sortito obtigit, a phrase of Plautus, Merc. 1. 2. 24.

3. Hibericis, of Spanish broom; Plin. N. H. 19. 1 and 7. Quin-
tilian (8. 2.) laughs at an advocate who spoke of ‘ herbae Hibericae '
meaning ‘Spartuni‚⁷ though no one in court knew what he meant.
Those who identify the object of the Epode with Menas notice the
connection of Sextus Pompeius with Spain, and also the appropriateness
of the instrument of punishment to one who had spent his life on ship-
board. In the army the centurion was armed with a · vitis)

peruste; Epp. 1. 16. 47 ‘loris non ureris?

7. metiente, walking from end to end of it. The ‘Sacra via ’ was a
lounge of men ofleisure3 Sat. 1. 9. 1.

8. trium, a necessary alteration it would seem of ‘ te1·‚’ the reading
which has vitiated all the MSS. and the text of the Scholia. The sense
of the true reading is given by Acr. and Porph„ ‘ cum sex ulnarum
toga⁷; but it is hard to see how ‘bis ter ulnarum' could be a Latin
form of expressing this. For the broad ‘toga‚’ spread out by the
elbows as a sign os importance‚ cp. Sat. 2. 3. 183 ‘Latus ut in Circo
spatiere‚' Epp. 1. 18. 30 ‘Arcta decet sanum comitem toga,⁷ Cic. Cat.
2. 10 ‘velis amicti non togis.'

9. ora vertat, ‘make them turn away,' Schol.; ‘make them turn to
look‚' Ritter. If· we may interpret Horace by himself, it will mean
neither, but rather ‘make their countenances ehange’; cp. Sat. 2. 8.
35 ‘ vertere pallor Tum parochi faciem.’

huc et hue. In prose it would be rather ‘huc et illuc'; cp. Epod.
2. 31 ‘hinc et hinc.⁷
