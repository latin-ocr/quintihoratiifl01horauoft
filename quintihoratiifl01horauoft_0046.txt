10 INTRODUCTION TO THE

to Maecenas (Od. 1. 1 and 3. 29, Epp. 1. 1 and 19), while the
last in both cases (Od. 3. 30, Epp. 1. 20) is reserved for the
poet⁷s own literary sels-consciousness ¹.

The Fourth Book of the Odes stands apart from other
collections in that the greater part at least of it was notoriously
composed with a purpose3 and therefore the plan of arrange-
ment may have been antecedent to the composition. But if
this difference must make us cautious in drawing sweeping
conclusions as to the other Books from the obviously conscious
and artistic arrangement² of Book iv, we may at least gather
that Horace contemplated a collection of poems being read
continuously in such a way that the effect of a particular poem
could be heightened or weakened by the sequence in which
it was placed; and we may learn something also of the
principles of taste which would be likely to guide him in
arranging other collections.

3, A marked feature of Horace's style is the irony with which
he professes to shrink from enthusiaffln, to be the poet of mirth
and love, ‘non praeter solitum levis‚' surprised‚ it rnay be,
occasionally into serious subjects, but recovering himself before
he has done injury to a theme sor which he is unfit ³. It is
this irony as much as the mere desire for variety that makes
him scatter his political poenis at such wide intervals. It is
this, as we shall see, that colours the prelude to Book iv3 and
though the relation between 1. 1 and 1. 2 is not worked out so
fully as that between 4. 1, 2, 3 and 4. 4, 5, it is substantially the
same. Od. 1. 1 has of course a relation to the whole three
Books; but it is not an accident that a poem, in which his
political saith is set forth most fully, should follow immediately

¹ For an additional argument for the designedness os the position
of 3. 29, see the correspondenee noticed40n 1. 1. 1 and 3. 29. 1, between
the opening address in the two Odes, bearing in mind that if Ι. Ι was
written for its place it must almost certainly have been posterior in
composition to 3. 29.

² See this drawn out in Introd. to Book iv.

³ Cp. the form of Od. 1. 6, 31⁸. 12, 4. 2, and the last stanza of 2. 1
and 3. 3. Μ -
