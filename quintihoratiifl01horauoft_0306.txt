2 70 HORA TJJ CARMJNA.

octavum lustrum. Horace's sortieth year ended on Dec. 8, 13.c. 2 5.
The ‘ lustrum' was properly the sacrifice performed by the censor after
completing the quinquennial census. Horace recalls, but avoids the

technical phrase ‘ condere lustrum: Liv. Ι. 44. For the inf. ‘claudere ' Ι

see Ap. 2, ξ 1.
ODE V.

‘ Lalage is not old enough sor your advances. Let her be a child a
little longer. Have patience, she will come to you by and bye, and
return the love greater than you ever gave to Pholoe or Chloris.'

‘ Incertum est quern alloquatur hae Ode utrum amicorum aliquem an
se ipsum‚’ Aer. Even if it be a soliloquy, the poet may be addressing
himself in an assumed character, as e. g. in Od. 3. 12. The Zurieh MS.
of the loth century (τ) has the inscription ‘ Ad Gabinium! The Ode
has nothing either to gain or lose by being supposed to have had
reference to any real persons.

The main image of the ode is one, as Dillr. says, ‘in antiquitate
usitata, a nostris moribus aliena.'

Line 2. munia comparis aequare, ‘ to match the labours of a yoke-
sellow‚’ cp. ⁴ serre iugum pariter,’ Od. 1. 35. 28.

5. cirea est, ‘is occupied with‚’ cp. the Greek phrases εἶναι περί τι,
ἔχειν ἀμφί τι.

6. fluviis, Virg. Aen. 7. 494, 495.

10. immitis uvae, ὄμφακος, according to the epigram (Brunck 3.
164) ὅμφαξ οὐκ ἐπένευσας, ὅτ’ ἧς σταφύλη παρεπέμψω.

lividos, of the dull blue of the grapes just beginning to turn.

11, 12⁴ distinguet . . colore. Is this merely the effectos Horace’s
collocation‚ ‘ streak the bunches with pu1·ple‚' ‘ varius‚‘ the epithet of
autumn, ‘the motley-coloured,' being placed between those words which
most recall the character which the epithet expresses? or does he, while
meaning ‘ distinguet purpureo colore,' allow‘purpureo colore’ as a
matter of grammar and primary sense, to go rather with ‘ varius ’ as a
description of personified Autumn ⁴ streaked with purple dyes‚' like
Epod. 2. 18 ⁶ decorum mitibus pomis caput Autumnus agris extulit ’?

13. ferox aetas. ‘Her time of life makes her shy, and time is
flying.’ To the rest of the sentence, ‘ aetas‚' in its general sense, alone
is the subj.; the epithet has no further relation to it. Cp. Od. 1. 21.
7, 8 ‘nigris aut Erymanthi silvis aut viridis Gragi: and 3. 23. 15, where
‘parvos’ is the epithet of ‘ Deos: so long as they are the obj. of
‘coronantem,’ not when they are the obj. of ‘tentare’ Dillr„ how-
ever, follows Mitsch. in taking ‘ferox' of the flight of time, ‘like an
unbroken horse‚' as Ov. Fast. 6. 77² ‘ fugiunt freno non remorante dies!
