INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV.

THERE is no reason to doubt the account given by Suetonius
of the origin of this Book. The occasion and general date of
it are fixed clearly on its own evidence. With the exception of
Ode 6, which is manifestly written at the same time as the
Carmen Seculare, i.e. in B.C. 17, all the Odes that can be dated
refer immediately to two events, viz. (Ι) the return of Augustus
to Rome in ΗΟ, 13, after three years’ absence in Gaul, whither
he had gone in the year 16, on the news of the defeat of Lollius
by the Sygambri ; (2) the double campaign of Drusus and Tibe-
rius in Raetia and Vindelicia, which occupied the year 15.

The general tone of the Book, as well as its particular refer-
ences, suits the period thus assigned to it. Its opening bears
witness to the interval which separates it from Horace's last
essays in lyric verse. Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 1-10 and 2. 1. 111. That
interval has brought marked changes in the poet's fortunes, as
well as in the political world. The contrast of 4. 5 or 15 with
1. 12 or 3. 24, is hardly more striking than that of 4. 3 with 1. 1.
The sons of Livia have taken the place of Marcellus; the
military triumphs, and the moral and social resorms which in
the earlier Books were prophecy, are now, if we may believe
Horace, history3 the Cantabrian, ‘non ante domabilis,’ is no
longer a cause of disquiet3 the Parthians have restored the
standards of Charrae, and Phraates and his quarrels are for-
gotten3 the vague alarms about the Dacian, or projects of
conquest in Britain, have given place to real dangers met on
the Rhine, and substantial victories won in the Eastern Alps.

, The position of one name in the Book marks more clearly still

the contrast between the two epochs, both in respect of the outer
world and of Horace's own life. Maecenas, whom even in
B.C. 19 he addressed as ‘prima dicte mihi summa dicende
camena,’ is mentioned but once in this Book. His birthday is
