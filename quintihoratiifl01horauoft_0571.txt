 

THE OXFORD BIBLE FOR TEAOHERS.

’ifinrattz frum &pluium (continued).

“The Oxrorm anz roa 'summas is the most valuable help to the
study os the Holy Scriptures, within a moderate compass, which 1 have
ever met with Ι shall make constant use of it3 and imagine that few
who are occupied with. or interested in the close study of the Scriptures.
will allow such a companion to be far from their side.''—T1m an. BAnnwm
Bnown.

“1 do not think Ι shall ever leave home without the Oxronn ann ron.
nicheas, for one can scarcely miss his ordinary books of reference when
this Bible is at hand⁴ Ι know no other edition which contains so much

valuable help to the readers—Tun REV. A. H. CHARTEROE, D.D.‚ Deam os tha
chazael Roval.

“The Oxrom) Bienns ron 'rucanas are as good as ever we can expect
to see.'‘—Tffl=: an. C. H. Sponsam«.

“Thia modest title of the work scarcely does justice to the range of sub-
Jects which it comprehends, and the quality of their treatment„ As a manual
of Biblical information and an auxiliary of Biblical study‚ it is unrivalled.
lt is as exhaustive as it is concise‚——no irrelevant matter has been intro-
duced, and nothing essential to Biblical study seems to have been omitted,—
and in no instance, so far as I can judge‚ has thoroughness or accuracy
been sacriflced to the necessities of conclamamus—Tun an. Romnu- N.
Yomm, os Headz‘nyzey Colleye, Leeds.

“The Oxrom) Brenn ron TnAcnnRs is really one or the greatest boons
which in our day has been offered to the reading public. The information
given is so various, and so complete, as scarcely to leave a single desidera-
tum. Το Christiane, in their quiet researches at home, or in the course
of extensive joumeyS‚ or in preparation for the duties of tuition, it is simply
invaluable‚ and constitutes in itself a Biblical Library. The range of topies
which it seeks to illustrate is very great, while the care and aceuracy mani-
fest in the articles deserves the highest praise. Itis no exaggeration to say,
that. to the mass of Christian people it saves the expense of purchasing
and the toil of consulting a library of volumes. At the same time, 1 know
no book more likely to stimulate enquiry‚' and to give the power of appre-
ciating further research into the history, structures, and meaning of the
Sacred oracles.”-Da Goonn, ns Edinburyh.

“These admirable Bibles must tend to extend the fame even of the Oxrord
Press.”—'I¹Hss mem Hox. W. E. GLADSTONE, Μ.Ρ.
