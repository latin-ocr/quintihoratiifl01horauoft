214 HORA TII CARMINA.

Line 1. modieis, of simple make and material; Epp. 1. 5. 2 ‘Nec
modica coenare times olus omne patella.’

2. cantharis, a kind of cup with handles (6 gravis attrita pendebat
cantharus ansa,' Virg. E. 6. 17), usually of large size (Plin. N. H. 33.
11 ⁴C. Marius post victoriam cantharis potasse Liberi patris exemplo
traditur‚' and the ‘cantharus' is the drinking-cup given to Bacchus
himself), and of common material. Horace names it among his table
furniture. rough, but scrupulously clean, in the parallel Epp. 1. 5. 23
· et cantharus et lanx Ostendat tibi te.’

Graeca . . ipse, both touches point to the care bestowed on the
process of racking it off from the ‘dolium.' Horace did it with his
own hands, and used a ‘testa ⁷ or ‘amphora‚' which still kept some of
the fragrance of the Chian or Lesbian which it had held; for ‘Quo
semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem Testa dius Epp. 1. 2. 70.

3. conditum levi, ⁴ stored and sealed.' The cork was secured by a
coating of pitch‚ Od. 3. 8. 9 ‘ Hic dies . . Corticem adstrictum pice
dimovebit Amphorae.' So to open an amphora is ‘ relinere‚' see on
v. 10.

in theatro, Od. 2. 17. 25 ‘quum populus frequens Laetum theatris
ter crepuit sonum.'

5. eques, see on Od. 3.16. 20, and 1. 1. 1.

paterni, because Maecenas is ‘ Tyrrhena regum progenies‚’ and the
river is the ‘Tuscus alx-eus,’ Od. 3. 7. 28; ‘ Lydius Tibris,' Virg. Aen.
2. 781. So that in the whole verse there is implied reference to both
topics of compliment‚ Maecenas‘ high birth and his modest state.
‘ Maecenas eques Etrusco de sanguine regum Intra fortunam qui cupis
esse tuam,' Prop. 4. 9. 1.

6. iocosa imago, see on Od. 1. 12. 3.

7. Vaticani. The theatre of Pompey, which was the only one
finished at this time. stood at the south end of the Campus Martius, so
looking across the Tiber on the Janiculan and Vatican hills. Juvenal
(6. 344) lengthens the second syllable in Vaticanus, and he is followed
by Martial.

9. Caecubum. The ⁴ Caecubus ager' was a marshy tract on the
coast os Latium between Terracina and Formiae. The wines chosen
to represent the finer Italian growths are two pairs of neighbouring
vintages‚ one pair in‘Latium. the Caecuban and Formian (Od. 3. 16.
34); the other in Campania, the Falernian and the wine of Cales (Od.
1. 31. 9.4. 12. 14).

10. tu bibes. It is easier to see the difficulty of this reading than to
convince oneself of the truth of any of the proposed remedies. If it
stands, it must mean, ‘ Ι must leave yon to drink‚ sc. at home‚' the
future, as iu Od. 1. 6. 1. There is undoubtedly great awkwardness in
