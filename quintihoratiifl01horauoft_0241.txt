NOTES. BOOKJ, ODE XVI. 205

parenthesiS, putting in another form what we have already had os the
priests of Cybele: and the main construction harmonizes not with them
but with the other clauses. ‘Non Dindymene. . non Apollo . . non
Liber aeque quatiunt mentem . . tristes ut irae.' Bentley, offended at
the anacoluthon, proposed to read ‘si ' for ‘sic‚' constructing as Od. 2.
17. 15 ‘Me nec Chimaerae spiritus igneae Nee si resurgat centimanus
Gyas Divellet unquam.’ ‘Not the Corybantes if they clash again,' cte.
His reading is accepted by Keller, Dillr„ and others, but in addition to
the fact that only the slightest ΜΞ. authority can be obtained for it,
there is the objection that it will introduce an entirely new idea, viz, the
effect of the Corybantian eymbals on the hearers, instead of what we
have in the rest of the stanza, the effect of the divine afflatus on the ἔνθεοι
themselves; and as the second-hand inspiration will be the weaker, the
result is an anticlimax.

9. tristes, ‘ill-omened,’ ‘ odious.'

irae, ‘bursts of passion!

Noricus, Epod. 17. 71. Noricum, the modern TyroL Styria‚
Carinthia‚ was famous for its iron‚ Plin. N. H. 34. 41.

10. deterret, frightens from their purpose.

naufragum, actively, as Virg. Aen. 3. 553 ‘navifragum Scylaceum.’

12. Iuppiter ipse ruens, cp. Od. 3. 3. 7 ⁶ Si fractusffiffitur-orbis
Impavidum ferient ruinae? The expression here contains a remembrance
of Ζεὺς καταιβάτηὲ, though the thought is not so much, as it is in the
Greek, of the thunderbolt, as of the vault of heaven crackhrg, ‘ ruit
arduus aether,' Virg. G. 1. 324, of the lightning, thunder, ancl rain; for
‘ Iuppiter⁷ of the sky, cp. Od. 1. 1. 25.

13 soll. The legend of Prometheus does not appear in this form in
extant Greek literature, see on Od. 1. 7. 21 and Epod. 13 introd. He is
the creator of man in the myth of Plato's Protagoras.

13-1'6. The simplest construction is to take ‘ addere ’ after ‘coaetus,’
‘apposuisse’ after ‘fertur,’ giving to ‘et' the sense of ‘etia1n,' ‘alsof
‘among the rest.’ Two other ways are proposed: (1) to take both in-
finitives after ‘ fertu1·‚‘ ‘ et ’ coupling thern together. It would be hard
to justify the change of tense, sor which there is no reason as there
obviously is in Od. 3. 20. 11, the passage usually quoted in illustr-auom
(2) to supply ⁴ esse ² with ‘ coaetus,' ⁶ fertur coactus esse . . et apposuisse ‘;
cp. Tac. Anu. 1. 65 ‘visus est . . obsecutus . . et repulisse.⁷

14. undique, from every animal ; A. P. 3 ‘Undique collatis membris.'
The Schol. Cruq. adds (possibly from an older commentator, and so con-
ceivably from some fuller version of the legend), ‘ Sic timorem depromp-
sit a lepore, a volpe astutiam.'

16. vim, to be taken closely with ‘ insani,’ which defines its meaning,
‘ the soree of the lion's fury.’
