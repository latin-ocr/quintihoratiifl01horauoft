36, suspensa mento explains ⁶ quantum exstant aqua,' ‘ as much as
is above water of a swimmer's body, when it floats as though it hung by
the chin.’

37. exsecta. This (or ‘execta’) is the reading osV and B, and of
the MSS. of Aer. and Porph. Bentley's objection that we require rather
an epithet to correspond with ‘aridum‚‘ is very well answered byRitter.

3. 4. 18, 4. 9. 29. The other MSS. offer many variants: ‘ exsucta‚’

41. non defuisse, ‘ was not wanting to her part'; see argument. The
