with which, his purpose aceomplished, he set out on his return to

torture and death.

Ι 46. auctor is opposed constantly to ‘suasor.' Sometimes as one who
brings wcight and dignity to back his advice; sometimes as one who

originates as well as urges a proposaL The senate acted ‘auctore

Regulo,’ ‘by the advice and under the influenee of Regulus.'

48. egregius exsul, an oxymoron, as ‘splendide mendax,’ 3. 11. 35.

49. atqui sciebat. Cp. the last sentence of the passage quoted in
the Introd. from De Officiis, ‘ Neque vero tum ignorabat [Regulus] se
ad crudelissimum hostem et ad exquisita supplicia proficisci, sed ius-
iurandum conservandum putabat.’

52. reditus, plural, as in Epod. 16. 35.

54. diiudicata lite. Cp. Epp. 1. 7, 76 ‘ Rura suburbana indictis . .
ire Latinis? The advice and protection of clients is represented as
one of the great burdens of the city life of the great in Rome. (Ep. 1.
5. 31 ‘postico falle clientem‚' etc.) whether the ‘lis,’ which is now
over, is one which the patron has heard and settled himself, or one in
which he has been supporting his client in court, is a question decided
authoritatively each way by about an equa] number of commentators,
but apparently on next to no evidence.

55. Venafranos, see on 2. 6. 16.

56. Lacedaemonium, 2. 6. 11 ‘regnata Laconi Rura Phalanto.’
Venafrum and Tarentum are named as places to which a Roman would
go sor his holiday. Notice the quiet ending of the poem, the con·
ventional epithet, raising no new picture, appealing at the most to
distant historical associations, feeding not so much the mind as the
ear, and even that with a certain sameness of sound. This characteristic
of Horace’s style is noticed in the Introd. to Books i-iii‚ ξ 11. 3, and
on Od. 2. 19. 31, 4. 2. 57. It belongs partly to himself, partly to the
poetic art generally. The passion in poetry which gives pleasure is
not unbridled passion, but passion felt to be measured and controlled
by mind. This is the intellectual side of the pleasure added to poe-try
by the recurrences os rhyme and metre.

ODE VI.

‘ We are suffering for our fathers' sins. They let the temples go to
min. They let the sacredness of marriage laws be tampered with.
Our blood is poisoned, and we go from bad to worse. They sprang
from different parents, and had healthier homes, who conquered Pyrrhus
and Antiochus and Hannibal. Our sons will be worse than we are.
Where is the remedy Ρ ’ ἱ
