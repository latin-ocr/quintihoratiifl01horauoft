1 9 6 HORA TII CARMJNA.

1ο his feet, and (here and in 4. 11) stands in the way of the poet's own
iniagined affections.

2. roseam, ‘lustrous,' Virg. Aen. 1. 402. Cp. Horace's ‘ purpureis
0¹·01ibus,'Od.4. 1.10: the notion of colour is lost in the more general
one of brightnes s.

cerea Seri 1115 on V' 1rg. E 2. 53, explains this epithet as meaning

5011, ' supple.’ Flavius Caper a grammarian older than Seivius‚ quotes
the passage as running ‘lactea . . brachia‚’ and interprets it ‘ candida‚' 1
which may mean either that he had found ‘lactea ⁹(possibly as a gloss on
'cerea ') or that he had interpreted ‘cerea,' ‘ white‚' and then forgotten
the exact word which Horace had used instead of the simple ‘ can-
dida)

4. difficili, χαλεπῷ. Cp. ἀργαλέος χόλος, Hom. ΙΙ. 18. 119, ‘difficult
to treats

iecur, the seat of passion with the ancients· ‚ so bilis?

5. neo mens nee color. Almost a zeugma, like Virgil‘s ‘inceptoque
et sedibus haeret in isdem,’ Aen. 2. 654; the use of the same verb of
a mental and a physical fact, ⁶ my mind reels and my colour comes and
goes.¹

S. quam lentis, slow‚ and so torturing.

¹4· perpetuum, ‘ constant?

15. oseu1a=‘1abella,’ ‘the pretty lips,· Virg. Aen. 1. 256 ‘Oscula
libavit natae?

16. quinta parte. Ibycus, according to Athenaeus, 2. p. 39 B, called
honey ἔννατον μέρος τῆς ἀμβροσίας. And the Scholiast‚ on Pind. Pyth. 9.
116, says that honey had been said to be δέκατον μέρος τῆς ἀθανασίας.
It 15 possible that Horace may have had some such words in his head in
giving this numerical ratio of the sweetness of Lydia's lips. Another
suggestion, to which Orelli inclines, is that he is thinking of Pythagoras'
division of the elements, earth, air, fire, water, and ether, the πέμπτον
ὅν, πέμπτη οὐσία, ‘quinta essentia‚’ the most perfect element; so that
‘quinta pars’ will mean the ⁶ purest and best ' of her nectar. ‘ Quirites<
sence‚' with other words of the Pythagorean philosophy, was affected by
the Alchemists, and has passed from them into modern language; but if
we use it in translating Horace we must keep it free from any un-
conscious associations of their chemical processes. It is the ⁶ best part,’
not what a modern perfumer would call the ‘ essence.'

20. suprema eitius die, ‘sooner than at death.' We may say that

‘citius' is used sor‘ citius quam, ’as ‘amplius' and‘ plus' ς ‘neque enim
plus septima ducitur aestas’ Virg. G. 4. 207, · or that the ablative does
double duty as the ablatixe of compat 15011 and os the point of time. Cp.

Od 4. 14. 13 ‘plusvice simplici.
