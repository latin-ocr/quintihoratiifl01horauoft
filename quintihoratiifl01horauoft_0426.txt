390 HORA TII CARMJNA.

singular as almost=‘ stuprum '—really 'indicate Horace's purpose in
preserring ‘vitiis'

41. porta eburna; Hom. Od. 19. 562 foll.² Virg. Aen. 6. 894.

42. somnium ducit, ‘the fancy brings a dream,’ i.e. comes in a
dream.

47. enitar, ‘I would use all my strength’; it contrasts with ‘multum
amati.'

48. monstri. Some good MSS. have ‘tauri‚’ but, as Orelli observes,
this reading was probably a gloss, helped to usurp the text by v. 72.
Europa has called it, in v. 45, ‘infamem iuvencum,' but she has learnt
long ago that it was not merely what it seemeds It should be noticed
that Horace imagines the bull to have vanished the moment he has landed
Europa on the Cretan shore. She is·then alone, conscious that she has
been brought there for a bad purpose, but thinking (vv. 63-65) of some
earthly ravisher, such as Paris, etc¹5 till Venus appears to reconcile her
to the honour intended sor her by Jupiter.

50. impudens. She repeats it, as though she had now found the
clue to her conduct, ‘ shameless ’ from beginning to end.

Orcum morory ‘keep Death waiting.'

512. si quis audis. The second person of the verb is used by a kind
os attraction. as the doubt ‘si quis’ cannot be addressed to a single
person. ‘O (lii, si auditis‚' or ‘O deus, si quis deorum audit.⁷ Dillr.
compares Virg. Aen. 4. 684 ‘Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor.’

5356. The point of this stanza is not quite obvious. Orelli thinks
she deprecates a tedious death, and quotes Soph. Ant. 817 soll. οὔτε
φθινάσιν πληγεῖσα νόσοις, οὕτε ξιφέων ἐπίχειρα λαχοῦσ’ ἀλλ’ αὐτόνομος
ζῶσα μόνη δὴ θνατῶν Ἀΐδαν καταβήσει. We might add the prayer of
the Chorus in Aesch. Ag. 1448 foll. sor death, but with the same reser-
vation, φεῦ τίς ἂν ἐν τάχει μὴ περιώδυνος μήτε δεμνιοτήρης μόλοι, κ. τ. λ.
But probably the thought is rather that she would make haste and let
her young beauty. the hated cause of her present condition, gain her a
death before it too vanished. It may at least be of some use if it makes
hen a dainty morse] sor a tiger. she loathes her beauty: it is not that
she would spare it from wsthering, or herself from seeing it wither.

58. hae ab orno, ‘you need not look sar.'

59. bene = ‘ opportune ' ; cp. Aesch. Suppl. 457 foll.

60. laedere, ‘to break ’ ; more usually ‘elidere,’ a conscious μείωσις.
Cp. Soph⁴ Ant. 54 πλεκταῖσιν ἀρτάναισι λωβᾶται βίον. It is a common
mode of sels-destruction in the heroic legends Cp. Jocasta (Ant. l. 6.),
and Antigone herself, ib. 1221 τὴν μὲν κρεμαστὴν αὐχένος κατείδομεν
βρόχῳ μιτώδει σινδόνος (= ‘ zona ’) καθημμένην.

61. leto, the dative of the purpose with respect to which they are
sharp. Dillr. points out the bitterness of ‘delectant’ The only reason
