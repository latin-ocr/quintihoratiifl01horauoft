ODES, BOOKS l—Jll. 11

on his opening apology for verse-writing as a taste not more ν
unaccountable than the thousand others that divide inan-
kind.

On its artistic side‚—that is where it assects his manner as
a principle of taste‚ rather than as a characteristic of his own
feelings or a prudential consideration of the judgrnent of the
world‚--—this irony is nearly connected with another feature of v
his style which will be noticed on 2. 19 (Introd. and on v. 31), s
3. 5. 56, and 4. 2. 57: Ι mean his affectation, in poems where
we have been wrought higher than usual, of a rather dull, even
conventional‚ ending, as though the passion ought to die away
in a diminuendo before the strain ceaseS. XYhen we are look-
ing for exemplifications of either of these feelings in the position
of a particular Ode, we must remember that they may pass
again by shades hard to define into the mere sense of the
relief afforded by contrast‚ an unwillingness to dwell too long
on any one note. An instance, where we cannot doubt an
artistic purpose· in the juxtaposition‚ and where this purpose
seems to hesitate between the first and second feeling which
we have traced‚ is to be seen in 1. 37, 38, where we must notice
that the slight Ode, with its picture of siinplicity and light-
heartedness‚ stands at the end of a long Book as well as irn-
mediately after the high-pitched Ode on Cleopatra.

Instances where we may see certainly the love of variety,
very possibly an undertone of irony, are the position of ‘ Quum
tu Lydia Telephi‚' after 1. 12, and that of ‘ Quid fles, Asterie ?'
after the stately Odes that begin Book iii. The mere desire to
change the key is well exemplified in t. 24, 25 and 3. 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29.

4. If 1. 38 has a fitness at the end of a Book, we may note
a similar fitness for their place in 2. 20 and 3. 1. The adapta-
tion indeed of these two Odes to their position was doubtless
what suggested the now abandoned theory of a separate publi-
cation of Books i, ii, and Book iii. That theory can really
derive no support {rom thern, sor it would necessitate, as we
have seen, an entire rearrangeinent of the Odes in a chrono-
logical order, in thev course of which all evidence would dis-
