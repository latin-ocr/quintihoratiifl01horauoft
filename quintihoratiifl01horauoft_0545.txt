 

INDEX OF METRES. 509

§ 6. A few words may be added on what is called by some
editors ‘ Meineke’s canon.' He noticecl that, with two excep—
tions, all the Odes¹ of Horace contain a number oflines which
is a multiple of four. of these, 3. 12 has just been discussed.
It 1135 been arranged by some persons in stanzas of four lines
(see Iixcurs. on it in Orelli⁷s edition); but it might fairly be
contended‚ either that the nature of the metre consisting not of
verses, but of feet, exempted it from the common category‚ or
that, inasmuch as it consists of four periods of ten feet each, it
complies with the same conditions as other Odes. The other
exception is Od. 4. 8, which contains thirty—four verses. It so
happens that this Ode already lay under some suspicion, on
account of the historical difficulty of v. 172. On these facts
Meineke laid down the general law that all the Odes conformed
to the type of the Alcaic, Sapphic, and third, fourth, and fifth
Asclepiad metres, and were to be broken into four-line stanzas.
Od. 4. 8 was to be rectified by the necessary amount of excision‚
or by the supposition of some lines having fallen out. It will
be seen, on examination, that the difficulties of 4. 8. 17 have
been exaggerated 3 and, at any rate, in the absence of any indi-
cation of such a quaternary division, either in the pauses of
the Odes themselves, or in the grammatical and metrical
writers <who are usually keen—eyed for ‘laws' in the greater
poets), the chief recent editors have not thought it necessary to
alter the Ode in obedience to the canon. Steiner pointed out
that, whatever may have been the case with the Odes which
are composed in couplets, there are but five other Odes besides
4. 8 (0111111111σ again, 3. 12) which are μονόστιχα, 01 of uniform

ὸ,
1116116, and that this is too small an area for such an important

induction.

¹ The law is not applied to 1116 Epodes, the very name of which pro-
bably implied 311 arrangement in couplets rather than four-line stanzas.
² Bentley had complained of the same line, on account of the metrical

irregularity of the caesura3 see above, ξ 1.
