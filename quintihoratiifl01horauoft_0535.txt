It seems useless to seek a full explanation of each case in the
doctrine that the infinitive was truly a substantive, which in-
volves the further difficulty that we must explain in what
relation (or ‘ case’) it stands to the leading verb (see Coning-
ton⁷s note on Virg. (ἶ. 1. 213). A Roman poet felt at once the
influence of Greek usage, in which the infinitive never lost its
substantival character, and of Latin precedents‚ which, if they
may be traced ultimately to a similar source, had yet ceased to
be coloured by any consciousness of it. That the infinitive
is treated at times by Horace as a substantive is clear from
such sentences as ‘dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,’ and
from its conjunction with a substantive in the instances quoted
below from Od. 2. 16. 39, Epp. 1. 19. 9.

The leading instances in Horace are, besides such common
verbs as ‘valeo‚' ‘ mitto‚' ‘parco‚' ‘fugio,'—

‘ occupat rapere‚' Od. 2. 12. 28 (so ‘ occupat in agrum Sabinum
transire‚’ Liv. 1. 30).

‘ urges summovere‚’ Od. 2. 18. 21.
