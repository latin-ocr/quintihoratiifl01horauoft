ille timorum Maximus haud urget, leti metus: inde ruendi In ferrum
mens prona viris animaeque capaces Mortis et ignavum rediturae parcere
vitae.’ The variant ‘paventes' is found in a few MSS„ and was read
apparently by Porph. It is preferred by Bentley, on the ground that
the variety ‘Galliae (plur. nom. as in Suet. Jul. 49 ‘Gallias Caesar
subegit,' and commonly) non paventes, duraeque tellus Iberiae,' is more
Horatian than two genitives dependent on ‘ tellus.’

ODE XV.

⁶ &Varlike victories, aster all, are what Phoebus forbade me to sing of.
The glory of Caesar's reign is not war; but peace, plenty, the standards
recovered from Parthia, and the gate of Janus closed—morality and the
old character that gave Rome her empire restored. While Caesar guards
us, there is no sear that citizen will list hand in civil war, or Dacian,
Mede, or Scythian in foreign war, For us, every day over the cheerful
family board, when the due libations have been made to the gods, we
will sing, as our fathers sang before ιις, of the great captains of past
time, and of the house of Anchises and Venus.'

We can hardly doubt that the Ode is intended as an epilogue to the
Book, the final answer to Augustus' request, It has been supposed by
many editors to carry internal evidence of having been composed as late
as Bc. 10. The sole argument is the mention in v. 9 of the closing of
the temple of Janus, which was taken to refer to the third closing in
Augustus' reign, which has been placed in that year. Franke shows
that the evidence even of this date is very doubtful, and in any case it
is admitted that the gate was closed in 29 and 25, and there is no word
in the Ode to fix the reference to a third elosing.

Line 2. increpuit lyra, in the common sense of ⁶ increpare,’ ‘to re-
prove‚’ but with reference to its original meaning, ‘ to make a noise at,'
‘thundered at me on his lyre.’ This mode of taking the words is
rendered certain by Ovid, A. A. 2. 493 ⁵ Haec ego cum canerem, subito
manifestus Apollo Movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae,' etc. All the
Scholiasts took ‘lyra’ with ‘loqui‚' and Ritter‚ of modern editors,
follows them. The general image is from Virg. E. 6. 3 ‘ Cum canerem
reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem vellit et admonuit?
