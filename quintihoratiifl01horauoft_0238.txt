202 HORA TII CARMINA.

16. thalamo, of Venus carrying him from the fight to Helen's
chamber, ΙΙ. 3. 381.

graveS‚ compare Homer's spear, βριθύ, μέγα, στιβαρόν; and there is an
Horatian contrast between the weighty spear and the light arrow ofreed.

17. Gnosii, Cretan, Virg. Aen. 5. 306 ‘Gnosia spicula'; E. 10. 59
⁴ Cydonia) .

18. celerem sequi, Ὀϊλῆος ταχὺς Αἴας, Hom. Il. 2. 527, etc.

20. crines. The MSS. are divided between this and ‘cultus‚’ ‘or-
naments’ Aer. read ‘ crines,’ as he illustrates it by Virg. Aen. 12. 99
‘foedare in pulvere crines.’ And the reference seems to be to the line
of Hom. quoted on v. 13. With ‘adulteros crines,' cp. ‘impia cervice‚’
3. 1. 17; ‘timido tergo‚’ 3. 2. 16; ‘libero terg0,’ 3. 5. 22; ‘iratos regum
apices‚' 3. 21. 20; and in Gr. ἐξ ἐλευθέρου δέρης, Aeseh. Ag. 328.

24. With some hesitation I have followed Orelli in reading ‘Teucer
et ’; Ritter. Dillenburger, and Keller, give ⁴ Teucer te.’ The MSS. are
fairly divided between these two readings and ⁶ Teucerque et‚' which
Bentley preferred. The Scholiasts do not help us; and though Cruquius
says that 3 Bland. read ‘Teucer te‚' he does not distinctly cite the
oldest. The considerations in favour of ‘et’ are: (1) that there was
an obvious metrical reason for altering it3 (2) that this reason, with
the reading itself, explains the double variation ‘ tes ‘que et? What
could be the motive for altering either of these to the other? (3) the
number of ‘ urgent.' ⁴ Tcucerque ' is awkward‚ as the position of ‘ que '
would seem to make ⁵ Salaminius’ an epithet of Sthenelus as well as
Teucer.

sciens pugnae, Homer's μάχης εὖ εἰδώς, ‘ citharae sciens‚' Od. 3. 9.
10. Orelli points out that the form ‘ sciens. . sive opus est‚' etc„ is
very likely from Hom. Od. 9. 49 ἐπιστάμενοι μὲν ἀφ’ ἵππων Ἀνδράσι
μάρνασθαι καὶ ὅτε χρὴ πεζὸν ἐόντα.

27. nosceS‚ ‘thou shalt come to know?

suxit reperire, App. 2. ξ 1.

28. melior patre, from Hom. Il. 4. 405, where Sthenelus says, ἡμεῖς
τοι πατέρων μέγ’ ἀμείνονες εὐχόμεθ’ εἶναι.

31. sublimi, a translation apparently of μετεώρῳ. Liddell and Scott
compare the phrase πνεῦμ’ ἔχειν ἅνω, ‘to b: out of brenths The
breath ⁶ is stopped niidway,’ can’t get down, but stays at the entrance of
the lungs.

35. iracunda classis, the anger which kept Aehilles’ ships apart
from the rest.

diem proferet, ‘ shall postpone the day of doom.’

34. Achillei, see on Ulyxei‚ Od. 1. 6. 7.

36. For the trochee, as the ² basis' os the line and in v. 24, see Index
of metreS, ξ 1.
