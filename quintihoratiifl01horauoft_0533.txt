IN THE ODES. 497

even added (see ibid.) the name of Terentia, Maecenas' wife,
under that of Licymnia. The possibility cannot be denied, but
the suggestion leaves us much where we were as to any canon
by which to know true persons from imaginary ones. No
tradition helps us, and Estre observes that the only instances
of such concealment of real names for which any tradition
vouches are instances where the true and false names were
metrically equivalent, a requirement which makes havoc of
several schemes of ⁴ amores Horatiani.’ We should still have
to leave as the representatives of different persons names
which suit almost every metrical foot of two, three, or four

“ syllables.

There is one unknown name in the Odes, that of Cinara
<Od. 4. 1. 4, 4. 13. 21, 22, Epp. 1. 7. 28, 1. 14. 33), which is per-
haps redeerned from this shadowy existence, both by the per-
sonal feelings that seem to accompany its mention and by its
recurrence among the reminiscences of the poet’s own life in
the Epistles. That a mere literary reminiscence, an echo of
his amatory poems rather than of his feelings, is intended
seems unlikely in the absence of the name from all his early
poems. The exception, however, tells rather against than for
the reality of the personages who are not similarly recalled ;
and Buttmann draws attention to the fact that this one unknown
person who seems more than a shadow is the subject only of
allusion, not of a substantive poem.

What has been said will obviously not apply with equal force
to the Epodes, where, in idea at least, personality is the essence
of the poem. The introduction of Horace's own name, as in

U Epod. 15, and the pursuance of his attack upon Canidia through

three Epodes ancl three Satires seem to indicate more real and
definite objects. But the use of poetical names for characters
who have no existence save at the moment begins doubtless in
the Epodes, as do other features of the Odes.
