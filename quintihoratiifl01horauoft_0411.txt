NOTES. BOOKJJJ, ODE XXIII. 375

12. pontificum, i.e. at public sacrifices; opposed to simpler home
rites.

13. nihil attinet, οὐδὲν προσήκει, ‘there is no need?

14. tentare, as it were ‘to lay siege to’ their goodwill. Cp. A. P.
405 ‘gratia regum Pieriis tentata modis,' and Virgil's ‘animam tentare
precand0,' Aen. 4. 113. ‘Deos' is constructed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ (see on 1. 3. 6)
aster ‘tentare' and ‘coronantem’; ‘parvos' is properly an epithet of
the images, not of the gods themselves, and therefore belongs to ‘Deos'
as the object of ‘ coronantem,’ rather than as the object of ‘tentare'
(see on 2. 5. 13); at the same time it is antithetical to ‘multa caede‚’
so that it cannot be severed from ‘tentares but serves rather as a link
between the two clauses, as though he said ‘your very gods are small
(i. e. in their representative images) : adapt your offerings to them.’

15. Parvo-²», as Tibull. l. c. ‘exigua ligneus aede deus.' Cp. with all
this Juv. 12. 87, 88.

marino rore, rosemary.

16. fragili, ‘easily plucked‚' a sprig of myrsse, opposed to more
elaborate and expensive garlands; so ‘simplex myrtus⁷ (Ι. 38, 5) op-
posed to ‘nexae philyra coronae.’

17—20. ‘ Though thy hand when it was laid on the altar held no gift,
it has softened the displeasure of the Penates with the pious offering of
meal and crackling salt, and could please no more with [i. e. if it
brought] a costly victim.’ ‘Si’=‘etiam si’3 ‘non blandior'=‘non
blandior futura‚' ‘non gratior iis futura per sumptuosam hostiam,'
Lambin. The Scholiasts Aer. and Porph. make ‘immunis⁷= ‘immunis
scelerum,’ the sentiment being then general, not special to Phidyle:
‘if the hand that is laid on the altar be exempt from crime, it softens‚'
etc., and the majority of editors follow them. The 'common meaning
of ‘immunis' is ‘exempted from some public duty or tax.’ It was used
metaphorically, but with a genitive case of that from which exemption
was claimed: Virg. Aen. 12. 559 ‘immunem belli,' and, to come nearer
to the present case, Ov. Her. 14. 8 ‘immunes caedis habere manus.’
But it is hard to see how ‘immunis' could have meant ὅ peaceful’ in
Virgil or ‘ pure from blood’ in Ovid, if the genitives had been omitted.
On the other hand, Horace uses the adj. in two other passages (Od. 4.
12. 23 ‘non ego te meis Immunem meditor tingere poculis,⁷ and Epp.
1. 14. 33 ‘immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci ’) in the sense of ‘without
gifts,’ adapting the word, aster his fashion, to the Greek ἅδωρος. Orelli,
giving up the theory of an ellipsis, tries, not very successfully, to bring
the word round to the Scholiasts’ meaning of ‘ guiltless,’ by explaining
it ‘quae nihil praestare debet,' ‘which owes no gift,’ i.e. which brings
what it brings sreely, not as a due to expiate any crime. But the whole
attempt to force this meaning on ‘immunis ’ seems to be founded on a
