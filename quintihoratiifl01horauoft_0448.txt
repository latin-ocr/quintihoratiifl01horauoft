41 2 HORA TII CARMJNA.

treatment have been suggested. ‘Ubere' has been taken as an epithet
of ‘ lacte,‘ but this is to transfer the redundancy from the expression to
the thought: or, again, ‘fulvae matris ab ubere’ has been referred to
the hind (Ritter)‚ but it is hard to see how this adds to the pieture;
the youth of the lion is in point, and the preoccupation of the hind, but
we do not want in any way to undervalue Drusus' foes. Bentley led
the way of conjectura] emendation, ‘iam mane’ or ‘iam sponte,' and has
been followed by many others. The simplest method is to separate ‘ab
ubere' to some extent from ‘depulsum,' and to take it in the sense of
‘fresh from his mother's teats.' Cp. ⁴ a matre pulli‚’ Columel, ‘recens
a vulnere‚' Virg. Aen. 6. 450; the place of Virgil's ‘recens’ is supplied
by the more definite ‘ lacte depulsum.'

16. peritura vidit, ‘looks up, and sees a moment before she dies by
his unfleshed tooth.' The repetition ‘vidit‚' ‘videress points the corre-
spondence, and makes it easier to dispense with a more formal intro-
duction of the apodosis; see on 2. 9. 9.

17. Raeti. . Vindelici. It is hard to say which is the adjective.
Geographically Raeti is the larger name of the two, being used to cover
Vindelicia <Raetia secunda) or the northern slopes of the Alps, from
the Lake of Constance to the Inn, as well as Raetia prima, the southern
part of the Grisons and the western Tyrol. Horace has the authority
of Dio C. 54. 22, in giving the common name of Raeti to the tribes
which Tiberius (Od. 4. 14. 14) and Drusus conquered. But it is eer-
tainly a perversion of the ordinary usage to assign the Vindelici, both
here and in 4. 14, to the invader who approached from the south. The
geographical difficulty is unafsected by the question of reading raised
by Heinsius, Bentley. and others, as whether we read ‘ Raetis’ or ‘Raeti‚'
the two names will still be given to one locality‚ and that the scene of
Drusus' victory. The MSS. and Aer. are in favour of the nominative.
The ablative‚ distributing the two names between the mountains and
the people‚ would be more in accordance with Horace's style, and it
would avoid the awkwardness, however it be explained, of the double
designation.

18—22. quibus . . sed. The digression is intended to elevate Drusus'
victory, by suggesting an immemorial and legendary antiquity for his
enemies. Its prosaic introduction‚ contrasting awkwardly with the
smooth finish of Horace's style, is an intentional, if not very successful,
imitation of Pindar. Cp. a slighter instance in 3. 4. 69. Many critics
(Lambinus, Buttmann, Meineke, amongst them) have been tempted‚ by
the fact that their excision would cause little or no disturbance os the
mette, to condemn the lines as an interpolation, supposing the sentence
to have run ‘ Vindelici diu ’ or ‘ Vindelici et diu.’ But the fanlts of the
verses are such as the poet is much more likely to have been guilty of
