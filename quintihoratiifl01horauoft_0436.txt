400 ΗΘΚΛ TII CARMJNA.

bonae. Perhaps as Dillr. thinks (quoting Lucr. 3. 1037 ‘bonus
'Ancus ³), the epithet implies that she has been some time dead.

4. sub regn03 see on Od. 1. 36. 8, and compare especially 3. 9. 9
‘ me nunc Thressa regit Chloe,' 2. 8. 18, 19 ⁶ servitus‚' ‘dominae.’⁸

For Cinara see Appendix I ‘ on the unknown names in the odes:

5. mater saeva Cupidinum. This line is intentionally repeated ¹

from 1. 19. 1. There Venus is invoked at the outset os the love-
campaign; here, after it was or should have been closed. It is the
ἄρχετε βωκολικᾶς and the λήὙετε βωκολικᾶς, the altered refrain os the
whole. ‘Dulcium‚' ‘saeva‚’ imply that he is balaneing the bitters and
sweets of the old lise.

6. cirea, os time, ‘hard upon my fiftieth year.’ The metaph. of
‘flectere’ is of breaking horses. He is too old and hard-mouthed now
for the soft guidance of Venus' rein. Cp. for the expressions Virg. G.
3. 188 ‘det mollibus ora capistris Invalidus,' ete„ and ib. 165 ‘Dum
faciles animi, iuvenum dum mobilis aetas,’ etc.

8. revocant, ‘ call you back! as to your proper place.

9. tempestivius, ‘you will be a more timely guest there.'

in domum. A rival reading with good support is ‘in d0m0’; but '
her ‘ car of swans ’ implies that ‘ comissari ’ is used rather in the Greek
sense of κῶμος, a moving band of revellers or serenaders (Theoe. 3. 1.
κωμάσδω ποτὶ τὰν Ἀμαρυλλίδα), than in its more usual Latin sense osa
stationary revel. The reading ‘comissabere’ is quite certain, but the
unusual word makes great havoe among the copyists. Some of the
best MSS. are at fault. ‘Comis habere‚’ ⁶ comitabere,’ ‘ commutabere‚‘

“ etc. For the future tense see on Od. Ι. 6. 1.

10. Pauli Maximi. Two persons are suggested, one or other of
whom may possibly be intended. (1) Paulus Fabius Maximus, consul ’
ac. 1 1, who would now be, unless he were made consul long before the
regular age, about forty years old 3 (ε) his son or nephew, Ovid's patron,
an intimate of Augustus, who was consul twenty years afterwards. It
is a question whether it is least improbable that Horace should call
his middle-aged friend ‘ puer‚' making the most of the ten years between
thern, or that the younger man should be spoken of in such terms when ‹
a mere boy.

purpureis ales oloribus, ‘ on the wings of lustrous swans,' i.e. in a
chariot drawn by them. Od. 3. 28. 15. For ‘purpureis' see on Ι. 13. 2
‘ roseam cervicem‚’ Virg. Aen. 1. 590 ‘lumenque iuventae Purpureum.’

12. iecur; 1. 25. 15.

idoneum, perhaps another reminiscenee of 3. 26. 1.

15. decens; 1. 4. 6.

14. ‘No tongue-tied champion of trembling prisoners.3 Cp. 2. Ι. 13 ¹
‘insigne maestis praesidium reis.’
