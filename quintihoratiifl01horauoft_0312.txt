2 76 , HORA ΤΗ· CA RMJNA.

Roman readers would have thought, of Alcaeus at Sigeum, Herod.
5. 95; see the lines of Alcaeus (Fr. 22 Bergk) conjecturally restored
from Strabo 13. p. 600 κᾶρυξ α’γγεῖλον μὲν ε’μοΐς ἑτάροισιν ἐν οἴκῳ Σῶς
Ἀλκαῖος 'Apa Ἔντεα δ’ οὐκ α’νένεικον ἂ δὴ κτέρας ἐς Γλαυκώπω Ἷρον
ἀνεκρέμασαν Ἄττικοι. Similar sels-accusations are quoted from Archi-
lochus, Fr. 5, and Anacreon, Fr. 27.

1 1. cum fracta virtus. Of his own share in the campaign the poet
professes to remember only the stolen holidays of carousing‚ the dropped
shield and flight; but this gives greater force to the few words in which
he speaks of the fall of the cause sor which he fought. He seems to say,
‘ What could I do when Valour itself broke‚ and those who threatened
so high bit the dust in defeat?’ Horace heartily embraced Octavius’
cause, and put his muse at his patron’s service. but he was not expected
to revile the party he had lest, ep. 1. 1 2. 35. Orelli suggests that there
is a reminiscence of Brutus’ last words, ςΩ τλῆμον ἀρετή, λόγος ἄρ’ ἧσθ’,
ἐγὼ δέ σε Ὦς ἔργον ἤσκουν, Dio C. 47. 49.

12. turpe, defeat is felt as disgrace, Od. 3. 2. 17 ‘ repulsae sordidae.'
From another point of view the poet may say ⁶ dulce et decorum est‚'
but here he is only speaking of the contrast between the hopes and the
event.

tetigere mento, probably the Homeric πρηνέες ἐν κονίῃσιν ὀδὰξ
λαζοίατο γαῖαν, Il. 2. 418, etc. Orelli, however, takes it of suppliants
throwing themselves at the conqueror’s feet.

13. sed me, opp. ‘tecum,’ v. 9. The ‘sed' contrasts the separation
of Horace’s lot from that of Pompeius in this stanza with their union
in the last.

Mercurius, the poet is a ‘ Mercurialis vir‚‘ 2. 17. 29. Mercury carries
him safely through the foe as he led Priam through the camp of Troy’s
enemies, 1. 10. 13 foll. Horace is thinking of the escape of Paris, Il. 3.
380, of Aeneas, 5. 344.

15. resorbens unda, the wave has thrown Horace high and dry, its
down-draught carries back Pompeius into the deep water. See a similar
image in Epp. 2. 2. 47 ‘ Civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma.’

16. fretis aestuosis seems to be one of Horace's ablatives absolute,
see on 2. 1. 12, ‘in that boiling surff

17. ergo, ‘now‚ then.’ It draws the conclusion of the whole review,
but specially refers to the reason for thanksulness just suggested in the
‘ freta aestuosa' in which he had been a second time immersed.

obligatam, properly ‘ obligari ² is said of the person, as in the next'

Ode, v. 5.

18. latus, see on 3. 27. 26.

lauru mea. Probably with a certain play, ‘my bay tree,’ the bay
being the appurtenance of poets god. 3. 30. 16, cp. 3. 4. 18) as well as
