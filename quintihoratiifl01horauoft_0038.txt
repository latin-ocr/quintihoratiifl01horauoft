2 INTRODUCTION TO THE

l. c. v. 30. And for the second argument, Epod. 16, to which
all Horatian chronologists give a very early date, would have
given Virgil as good an idea of his disposition and poetical
powers as any of the less important Odes. Franke’s conclu-
sion is at least a safe one z ‘Since there is no Ode which can
be proved indisputably to have been written before the battle
of Actium, while I will not indeed assert positiyely that one or
two may not possibly have been composed earlier, I yet think
that we should be very chary of separating without clear cause
any single Ode from the epoch common to the others.'

§2 The second lz'mit, the latest date at which the Three
Books as a whole can have been published, is fixed mainly by

the reference in Od. 1. 12. 45-48. Marcellus died in the autumn ἴ
of ΒΕ. 23. It is inconceivable that these lines should be (as =
Ritter suggests) a complimentary allusion to one already dead ; -·÷
an assurance to Augustus that at least the fame of his son-in· Ἴ

law survived: all that the author of the dirge on Quintilius

could offer to match Virgil’s ‘Tu Marcellus eris? And it is ⁸

almost equally impossible that, written before his early death,
they should have been published (as from other considerations
it would be necessary to conclude) within a year or two of

that great disappointment of the hopes of Rome and of the '

Emperor.

An argument, second only in weight to this, is founded upon ξ

the Odes (2. 10 and 3. 19) which haye reference to Licinius

Murena, the brother of Terentia, Maecenas’ wife (see also on κ
Od. 2. 2. 5). Murena was executed for participation with Fan- ξ

nius Caepio in a conspiracy against Augustus in B.C. 22. The
presumption seems very strong that even if Horace's feelings

would have allowed him to publish these poems, and especially - ⁴
Od. 2. 10, after his friend's catastrophe, he would have been ¹

deterred by the knowledge that the reminiscences must be

displeasing to Maecenas as well as to Augustus. Franke ·

recalls the story of Virgil's striking out the praises of Gallus
from the end of Georg. iv on somewhat similar grounds.

The arguments sor postponing the publication of the Odes to
a later date are not such as can really be set against these con-
