Line 2. reconditum, put safely away in the inner bins: cp. ‘interiore
nota‚’ 2. 3. 8.

3. strenua, with ‘prome,' ‘ be vigorous and bring’; it almost begins
the metaphor of the next verse, ‘show vigorous generalship.’ The
Caecuban is the artillery that must be brought to bear against the strong
entrenchments of their seriousneSS.

Caecubum; on 1. 20. 9.

4. sapientiae; 3. 21. 14.

5. inclinare meridiem, in prose, ‘ sol meridie se inclinavit‚' Liv. 9·
32, ‘the noon has passed its sull.' There, if anywhere, the day might
be expected ⁶ stare? It need not imply any very early hour.

7. horreo, a ‘store’ generally, having lost its original meaning of
a stoi-e os grain; 1. 1. 9. Here it is=‘apotheca'; see on 3. 21. 7.

8. cessantem, as though it were the fault of the wine that it came
no quicker.

Bibuli. C. Calpurnius Bibulus, cos. with C. Julius Caesar, B.C. 59.
There is doubtless a play on his name.

9. nos cantabimus invicem. Either ‘nos‘=‘ ego,' 3. 11. 51,
3. 27. 14, and ‘invicem' meaning ‘in my turn'; or, more likely (as
Orelli), ‘ We will sing in turn (‘carmine amoebaeo’) of Neptune,' etc„
the sentence beginning as though ‘invicem ' would have been enough to
point out that ‘ Neptune and the Nereids ’ were to be the subject of one’s
song, Latona and Diana of the others and then ‘tu recines’ having
been inserted to make the antithesis more clear. For the division
cp. 1. 21.

11. recineS‚ of an answering song, as in 1. 12. 3 osan echo. The
correspondence of the songs is indicated by the metrical correspondence
of vv. 10 and 12.

13. quae. What is the antecedent? ‘eam‚’ sc. ‘recines' or ‘can- ¹

tabimus '; or ‘ea‚' sc. ‘dicetur’'? In any case, probably, it is not
intended to limit to Lyde the song addressed to Venus.

14. fulgentes; 1. 14. 9.

15. oloribus. For Venus’ car drawn by swans see 4. 1. 10.

16. Nox; 3. 19. 10.

nenia, not necessarily a mournful song, as we see from Epp. 1. 1. 63
‘ pueromm nenia)

ODE XXIX.

The Ode begins with an invitation to Maecenas to visit the poet ζῆ

apparently at his Sabine farm. ‘ Everything is ready for his reception. ,
Why does he delay‚ look out of his window on the distant count1y‚ yet ³
stay amid the grandeur and discomsorts of the city? Change is pleasant,
