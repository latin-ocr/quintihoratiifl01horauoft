lies between an z' or an e, an e or an a, one or other expansion
of an ambiguous abbreviation, and the like, MS. testimony
cannot be held to settle it absolutely, without any appeal to
grammar or sense. We rnust add that in the majority of really
1 doubtful readings no theory with respect to the external testi-
mony will elicit other than an ambiguous answer from it. In
these, if to the end we must give full room to doubt, we can
hardly help balancing in our ininds the fitness on other grounds
of the rival claimants.

Ι. MSS.
1. As has been already said, no MS. of Horace is known to

' be in existence older than the oth century. We have, how-
ever, in the edition of Cruquius (Antwerp, 1578), frequent testi—

mony to the readings of at least one MS. of greater antiquity‚ ‘⁴

ζ the one, namely, which is known as the ‘Vetus Blandinius.'
z In preparing his edition, Cruquius had the benefit of consulting
ζ four MSS. then extant in the Benedictine abbey of S. Peter,
² ‘ in monte Blandinio⁷ (Blankenberg), near Chent. These MSS.
ἶ all perished, as he tells us (see his note on the Inscription to
3 Sat. B. I, p. 308 of his Edition), in the sack of the abbey by a
mob of ‘iconoclastss in the outbreak of 1566. His own esti-
mate of their date puts them all as early as the oth century.
ἒ One whose loss he specially laments, he distinguishes through-
* out from the rest as ‘vetustissimus' This is the MS. referred
ἶ 'to in most editions as V.

Ἰ The general opinion of Horatian scholars, from Bentley
onwards, has attached the very highest value to Cruquius' MS.
ν’ Keller and Holder, as will be seen, set less store by it. Its
Α readings correspond very largely with those of B (the old
ξ Bernese MS. : see below) where that is extant, and in the Satires
³ and Epistles it is followed most closely (especially in the famous
J variation Sat. 1. 6. 126 ‘campum lusumque trigonem,³ where,
Ι

3 name in Od. 3. 20. 15, Epod. 15. 22, but all the MSS. have ⁶ Nereus,'
, ⁴ Nerea.’ The certain form ‘Alyattei,‘ in Od. 3. 16. 41, has had to be
J restored by modern scholam, the MSS. being utterly at sea ‘halyalyti,’
⁴ aliat thii,’ etc. The unmetrical ‘tricenis' in Od. 2. 14. 5; has over-
* whelming MS. support.
