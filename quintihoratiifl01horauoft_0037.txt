INTRODUCTION TO BOOKS I—III OF
THE ODES.

1.-ΤΗΕ CHRONoroGY OF THE ODEs. r

§ 1. THE general period during which the greater number of
the Odes of Books i—iii must have been composed can be fixed
with some certainty. The later limit will be discussed pre-
sently. The earlier lz'mz't is fixed by the Battle of Actium.
Epod. 9 was written when the news of the victory first reached
Rome, while even the direction of Antony's ssight was still
unknown. Od. 1. 37 is written on Cleopatra's death in the
following autumn, B.C. 30.

It is of course possible that some of the Odes may have
been composed before the Epodes were finished, but there is
none that bears any clear mark of it. Milman‚ who holds that
some of the Odes must have been among Horace⁷s earliest
composstions, attaches much weight to the consideration that
the verses which his poverty drove him to write (Epp. 2. 2. 51),
and which would have been his introduction to Vir-gil and
Varius, and their ground in speaking of him to Maecenas (Sat. Ι.
6. 54), must have been ‘ something better than one or two coarse
Satires and perhaps a few bitter iambicsf Franke7 on the other
hand, sees in the first passage rather an explanation of the bitter-
ness of his early writings‚ the writings of a man who had lost all
he had and was angry with himself and the world, ‘vehemens
lupus, et sibi et hosti Iratus pariter, ieiunis dentibus acer,'
