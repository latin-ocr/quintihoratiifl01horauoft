282 HORA TII CARMJNA.

Greek γνῶμαι, e. g. παντὶ μέσῳ τὸ κράτος θεὸς ὤπασεν, Aeseh. Eum. 529;
πολλὰ μέσοισιν ἄριστα· μέσος θέλω έν πόλει εἶναι, Phocyl. ap. Arist. Pol.
4. 1 1. It is here both the mean estate and the moderatiori of mind which
is content with it.

6-3. ln point of grammar, doubtless, ‘tutus ’ belongs to the first
clause, ‘sobrius ' to the second; ‘ he avoids the meanness of a ruinous
hovel and is safe, is sober and avoids the palace that raises envy'; but in
sense, ‘sober and therefore safe' is the idea of the sentence, and neither
adjective is confined to its own clause. The safety of moderatiori is
dwelt on further 1n the next stanza, its prudenee in the one following,
which suggests the mutabilit) of fortune

7. invidenda, as Od. 3. 1. 45 ‘invidendis pos stibusss in the same con-
nection.

9— 11. ingens, celsae, summos, all' 1n emphatic positions‚ ‘for their
height. Cp. Herod. .10 ὁρᾷς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα ζῶα ὡς κεραυνοῖ ὁ θεὸς οὐδὲ
ἑᾷ φαντάζεσθαι, τὰ δὲ σμικρὰ οὐδέν μιν κνίζει· ὁρᾷς δὲ ὡς ἐς οἰκήματα
τὰ μέγιστα αἰεὶ καὶ δένδρεα τὰ τοιαῦτ’ ἀποσκήπτει τὰ βέλεα,

13. infestis, seeunffis, ablative absolute.

14. alteram sortem, ‘ 3 change of fortune.’

17. male, sc. ⁶ est? Od. 3. 16. 43, Epp. 1. 1. 89, ‘ bene est?

18. quondam, ‘sometimes' ‘ Quondam etiam victis redit in prae-
cordia virtus, ’ Virg. Aen. 2. 367.

19. areum, theb bow with which he infficts death plague etc„ as in
Hom. 11. 1. 49. 382, etc. Cp. Carm. Saec. 33¹ Condito mitis placidus-
que telos

21. angustis, ‘in straits of f01·tune.' This metaphor seems to suggest

the return to the metaphor of the first stanza, good fortune being the
οὖρος before which we run fast and free.

22. appare, ‘show yourself!
23. nimium, with ‘ secundo,' ‘ dangerously favourable‚' δυσούριστον.

ODE XI.

‘Do not trouble yourself with foreign polities, Quintius, nor with
schemes of business. Life wants very little, and it is flying fast: spring
flowers die and moons wane. Do not weary yourself over plans as if
things remained for ever. Better crown with roses our hair-s already
whitening with age, and drink and play while we may.'

Nothing is known of Quintius Hirpinus; possibly he is the same as
the Quintius to whom Epp. Ι. 16 is addressed.

The nature of the name ‘ Hirpinus ¹ is not certain. It is very probably
a local name (as ‘ Marrucine Asini‚¹ Catull. 12. 1), the Hirpini being a
Samnite tribe, of which Beneventum was the capital.
