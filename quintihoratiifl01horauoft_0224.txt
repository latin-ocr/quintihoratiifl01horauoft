188 HORATJJ CARMINUM

describe rather the depth and firmness of the snow, as Virgil's ‘ pulvere
caelum stare,' Aen. 12. 407, of a thick and palpable cloud of dust; as
we should say, ¹ stands deep in snow.'

2. Soracte, Virg. Aen. 11. 785, hod. ‘Monte S. Oreste'; a mountain
of Etruria, 2,420 feet high, about twenty-six miles north of Rome. Its
striking outline, separated from the main range of the Sabine hills by
the broad Tiber valley, makes it a conspicuous feature in all northern
views across the Campagna.

4. acuto, ⁴ piercing.’ Virgil's ‘ penetrabile frigus,’ G. 1. 93.

5. dissolve. The srost is a chain that binds man as well as the
earth and streams. Od. 1. 4. 1 ⁴ solvitur acris hyems.7

6. reponam, piling, laying again and again. The participle is
gerundial: it gives the precedent action, or means by which the main
aetion is to be accomplished.

7. deprome. The verb is used both of ‘bringing out' wine from
the ⁴ apotheca,' or other place of storing, Od. 1. 3 7. 5 ‘depromere Cae-
cubum Cellis avitis’; and os ⁶ drawing it off’ from the ‘amphora,' or
some larger vessel, as in Epod. 2. 47 ‘ promens dolio ⁷ The latter sense
seems to be given to it here by the addition of ‘ benignius.’

quadrimum, four years was a fair time to keep wine of the kind.

Sabina. Wine from a Sabine jar=Sabine wine; cp. Od. 3. 16. 34
‘ Laestrygonia amphora.' Sabine wine was not among the better kinds,
but it was such as Horace would drink himself, Od. 1. 20. 1. and he
supposes the person whom he addresses to have means such as his own.
‘ A fire and some wholesome country wine are enough to keep out the
cold.’

8. diota, probably the same as the ‘ amphora.’ Both names refer to
the two handles οι· ears.

9. Epod. 13 ⁴ Cetera mitte loqui: Deus haec fortasse benigna Re-
ducet in sedem vice! ‘ Make the best of winter, its storms will cease
when the gods will, and spring will come back.’ There is certainly
there, and probably here also, a suggestion of a winter and spring of

fortune; ep. Od. 3. 29. 43 ‘Vixiz cras vel atra Nube polum pater
occupato, Vel sole puro.'

simul = ‘ simulac.'

11. deproeliantes, see on Od. 1. 3. 13.

13. fuge quaerere, Od. 2. 4. 22 ‘fuge suspicari’; Epp. 2. 2. 150
‘ fugeres mirarier)

14. luero appone, set it down as clear gain.

16. neque tu, ‘ nor, pray,' calls especxal attention to the prayer
which follows, Epp. 1. 2. 63 ‘ hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catenis';
Luc. 2. 637· ‘nec Pharnacis arma relinquas, Admoneo, nec tu populos
utraque vagantes Armenia '; so the Greek σύ γε. See on 1. 11. 1.
