patet sera regnat Erinnys‚' Virg. Aen. 7. 99 ‘nepotes Omnia sub pedibus,
qua Sol utrumque recurrens Aspicit Oceanum vertique regique vide-
bunt.'

habitabiles oras, a translation of ἡ οἷκουμένη.

6. maxime principum, not as though ‘princeps' had yet become
a general title sor a rulcr in any time or people‚ as we might say
‘ greatest of princes,' but only a hyperbolical form of ⁴ maxime princeps.'
It is himself and his own office that is generalized: Horace cannot con-
ceive a greater than him in his own character. For the title ‘ princeps’
see on 1. 2. 50.

7. quem . . didicere . . quid posses, a familiar idiom in Greek,
Soph. O.T. 15 ὁρᾶς μὲν ἡμᾶς ἡλίκοι προσήμεθα, the subject of the sub-
ordinate verb being attracted into the accusative, as though it were the
direct object of the leading verb. It is imitated frequently by Terence,
as in Eun. 3. 5. 18 ‘me noris quam elegans siem‚’ Madv. ξ 439> obs. 1.
The general expression ‘didicere quid posses' answers to 4. 4. 23-28
‘ sensere quid posset)

9. milite tuo; cp. v. 33.

10. Genaunos, Breunos, two Rhaetian tribes. The name of the
first is thought to be still traced in the Val (li Non, which runs N. W.
from the valley of the Adige at S. Michele, half-way between Trent
and Botzen3 the second in the name of the Brenner Pass itself, and the
town of Brunecken.

implacidum, a word not found before Horace.

11. veloces, moving swiftly from place to place.

13. deiecit, a word specially applicable to the forts built on the
brink of precipices (v. 12); so that it has here something of the effect
of a zeugma, though it is a usual word for ‘dislodging’ an enemy.
Epp. 2. 2. 30,

plus vice simplici. ‘ Quia dupla quam dederant clade perculsi sunt,'
Porph., ‘with more than a bare requital (“vicem reddere'')‚' ‘with heavy
interest.' It corresponds to ‘sine clade,‘ v. 32. Lambinus understood
it asz‘more than once.’ ‘ Plus ’ =‘ plusquam ’; cp. 1. 13. 20 ‘suprema
citius die,' ‘ sooner than on the last day.⁷

14. maior Neronum, Tiberius; See Introd. to the Book.

17. spectandus . . quantis, θαυμαστὸς . . ὅσοις, a brachylogy less
common in Latin than in Greek. For its effu in bringing the relative
clause into closer relation with the leading clause we may compare 1,·
33. 1 ‘doleas . .cur pi·aeniteat'; for the mctlzod we may compare v. 7
of this Ode, inasmueh as the passive ‘spectandus quantis,' etc„ implies
a possible active, ¹ spectare aliquem quantis,' etc. For the violation of
the usual caesura see Index of Meu-es.
