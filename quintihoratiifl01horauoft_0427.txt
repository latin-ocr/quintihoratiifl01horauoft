the father for the moment can imagine why she should not hang
herself, is that she is caught by the charms of some other form of
death.

62. procellae, the swist stormwind. The idea seems to be that she
is to trust herself to the wings os the wind, which will carry her quick
to the bottom.

64. carpere pensum; Prop. 4. 3. 15 ‘tristes sua pensa ministrae
Carpebant. medio nebat ct ipsa loco‚' of maidens carding their ‘weighed
portions ' of wool for the mistress to spin.

65. sangujs; 2. 20, 6, 4. 2. 13, OS. 49.

66. barbarae, ‘foreign,' as though a Greek, and not a Tyrian, were
talking. Cp. Conington on Virg. Aen. 2. 504. The ‘pellex' will be
at the command of the native queen, as Cassandra at Clytemnaestra’s
in the Agam.

67. perfidum ridens; 1. 22. 23, 2. 12. 14, 2. 19. 6. Her ·‘ smile of
1reachery' is partly at the success of the device which has beguiled
Europa; partly (the emphasis being rather on ‘ridens,’ which comes
to some extent παρὰ προσδοκίαν), with a more playful meaning, at
Europa’s misplaced grief, which she is about to allay. Cupid has his
bow unstrung, to show that his work is over.

69. abstineto irarum; see on 2. 9. 17.

71. cum, ‘since’ Venus repeats Europa's words in vv. 45 foll.:
‘You shall see him who was the bull again, and you shall have the
power to tear his horns as you wished, if you still desire it.’

73. uxor esse neseis. Either the Greek construction for ‘uxorem
te esse nescis’; or. as Orelli prefers, = ‘ tanquam uxorem te gerere neseis,'
‘you know not how to play the wise.'

75. sectus orbis, ‘ half the world?

76. nomina, plural, as 4. 2. 3 ‘daturus nomina pont0.’

ODE XXVIII.

The poet represents himself as about to celebrate the ‘ Neptunalia’ by
a carouse, in company with Lyde a ‘psaltria' Cp. 4. 11. ‘ What can he
do better on such a day ?’ He bids her ‘ bustle about and bring out the
old Caecuban; their sobriety will need a good deal of storming. There
is no time to lose; the day is already waning. They will sing in turns :
he of Neptune and the Nereids, she of Latona and Diana; then both
together of Venus and of N ight.'

The Neptunalia were held on July 23. Festus mentions the custom
of celebrating the day by erecting booths of boughs called ‘umbrae'
along the bank os the Tiber. ·
