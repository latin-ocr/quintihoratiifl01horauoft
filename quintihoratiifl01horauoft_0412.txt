the acceptable gift may be assumed by the poet, but it is not expressed.
The doctrine is simply that the gods do not look for costly offerings
from humble worshippers. If ‘ immunis ' meant ‘immunis scelerum,’ it
would be the most weighty word in the Ode, and Horace would not
have left his readers to make up the distinctive part of its meaning by
conjecture. The last three lines of the stanza have been construed
variously. ‘The interpretation given above is that followed by Orelli,
Ritter, and Dillr. Bentley took ‘sumptuosa hostia' as a nominative,
defending the a either as lengthened by the following ‘bl,’ or as the
parallel of ⁵ si non periret immiserabilis‚’ 3. 5. 17, q. v. ‘ A costly victim
does not soothe the displeasure of the Penates more winningly than,⁷ etc.
19. mollivit, notan aoristic, but a regular perfect, as is shown by the
conditional clause to which it answers: ‘if the offering has been made,
the gods are satisfied.’ Several of the best MSS. have ‘ mollibit’ [and
it is so quoted by Servius} but the perfect is supported by Stat. Silv. 1.

seem like imitations; and we may probably follow Bentley in refusing
to admit what would be a solitary instance in Horace of this form of
the future in a doubtful reading, and against the silence of the old gram-
marians, who are quick to notice any such varieties.

the salt in the fire was taken for a good omen. If so, the two epithets

ODE XXIV.

’ ‘Riches and luxurious abodes can stay neither care nor death. The
Scythians live more wisely‚ with no settled homes, no stores of wealth.
They have not the vices of civilized life. Their women do not poison
their step-children, nor rule their husbands, nor break their marriage
vows. &Vho would be known as the saviour and father of his country?
Let him check the licence of the time. He may be hated by his con-
ternporaries, but he will be glorious to all ages. lt is no good to com-

give the lie to them, while we scour sea and land for the sake of money,
and think poverty the one shame. Let us get quit of our wealth: root
out the evil if we are really tired of it, and train our sons in a manlier
