238 HORATIJ CARMINA.

5. aestuosae Calabriae, cp. on the same topic Epod. 1. 27 ‘ Non ut
iuvencis illigata pluribus Aratra nitantur mea3 Pecusve Calabris ante
sidus fervidum Lucana mutet pascuis.'

A second investment of Roman wealth, large cattle farms; cp. Od. 2.
16. 33 ‘Te greges centum Siculaeque circum Mugiunt vaccae‚' etc.;
Epp. 2. 2. 117 ‘ Quid vici prosunt aut horrea? quidve Calabris Saltibus
adiecti Lucani?’

grata, ¹ pleasant‚' to own or to see.

6. Α villa adorned with gold and ivory; cp. Od. 2. 18. 1 ‘ Non ebur
neque aureum Mea renidet in domo lacunar.’

7. rura, i. e. as the next stanza shows, the wine-growing lands
through which the Liris (now the-Garigliano) flows. On the left bank ,
of the Liris, as it nears the sea, is the Ager Falernus, and at a short
distance the Mons Massicus.

8. mordet, Lucret. 5. ‘257 ‘ripas radentia flumina rodunt.’

9. ‘ Let who may own rich vineyards at Cales, 1 grudge them not.’

premant=‘ reprimant,’ check the luxuriant growth3 Virg. G. 1. 156
¹ ruris opaci Falce premes umbram? The words are probably meant
to imply the richness of the soil and luxuriance of the vines. Cales
was a town in the north of Campania. Its wine is named in Od. 1.
20. 9, 4. 12. 14.

calena falce (cp. 3. 6. 38) involves a slight hypallage, i. e. the ad-
jective would more naturally go with ‘vitem.' ⁶ At Cales’ is the simple
meaning. XYhen for the local case or adverb an adjective is substituted‚
there are possibly several words in the sentence with which it may
without positive impropriety be made to agree. The prose writer
chooses the most obvious, the poet very likely the least obvious.

10. vitem, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, with ‘ premant' and ‘ dedit?

et. Some good MSS. (including B) have ‘ ut‚' which also stands in
the lemma of Porph. If we read ‘ut’ there is a taunt against the wine-
grower who toils that other men may drink os his wine, as well as
against the trader who risks his life for his gold cups and rare wines.
The irony would be not unlikely to attract an emendator, but it seems
beyond the requirements of this place. We want the ⁶ exsiccet‚’ ‘let
him drain,⁷ that Horace may acquiesce in the good fortune of the
trader, even is he afterwards undervalues it.

11. exsiccet, ‘ eum aliqua aviditatis significatione‚’ Orell.

eulunis, A. P. 434, apparently used sor ‘large cups.' According
to the Schol. they were originally ‘ calices fictiles quibus pontifices
virginesque Vestales in sacris utebantur!

12. Syra reparata merce, obtained by bartering Syrian wares. The
meaning of ‘ reparo' seems to be ‘to obtain in exchange,’ the ‘re'
playing the part of ἀπὸ in ἀποδίδοσθαι, ‘to give for a consideration:
