NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXXIII. 241

3. vivat. Epp. 1. 19. 2 ‘nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina
possunt.'

die, Od. 3. 4. l; Theogn. 761 φόρμιγξ δ’ αὖ φθέγγοιθ’ ἱερὸν μέλος.

Latinum, for it is a Greek lyre that is called upon to give music to
Roman ears. Horace is ‘ Romanae fidicen lyrae,' Od. 4. 3. 23. The
main antithesis is contained in the words ‘ Latinum‚⁷ ¹Lesbio,' helped
also probably, as Dillr. suggests, by an antithesis which might be felt
between the Greek and Latin ‘barbite‚' ‘carmen' See on Od. 1.
1. 34.

5. modulate, used passively as ‘ rnetatus‚' Od. 2. 15. 15, S. 2. 2. 114 :
‘abominatus‚’ Epod. 16. 183 ‘ detestatus‚' od. 1. 1. 24. See Madv.
ξ 153.

civi, emphatic: cp. Od. 1. 2. 21. Of Alcaeus* strenuous participation
in the politics of Mitylene we have proofs in the fragments 15—23,‚
classed together by Bergk as στασιωτικό. (‘Alcaei minaces Camoenae‚’
Od. 4. 9. 7).

6. ferox bello. Alcaeus fought against the Athenians in the Troad
(Hdt. 5. 95), and against Myrsilus and Pittacus, ⁴ tyrants ’ of Mitylene.
‘ferox'=‘quamquam ferox erat? With this stanza ep. Od. 2. ¹3-
26 ‘te sonantem plenius aureo Alcaee‚ plectro dura navis, Dura fugae
mala, dura belli.'

11. Lycum. His name occurs in Alc. Fr. 57, Bergk.

nigris oeulis. A. P. 37 ‘Spectandum nigris oculis nigroque ea-
pino!

15. cunque. This is the unanimous reading of the MSS. and was
found by all the schol„ who explain it by ‘quandocunque' If so.
we must either say that Horace, who abbreviates ‘quandocunque' to
‘ quandoque’ (Od. 4. 1. 17, etc.)‚ has here treated ‘cumcunque' (see
Lucr. 2. 113) in the same way3 or, that he has used ‘cunque ⁷ (which
generalizes relatives and relative particles of all kinds, and which is
constantly separated from the word which it generalizes [Od. Ι. 9. 14.
ete.])‚ after the analogy of ποτέ, with the temporat participle. Nothing

else is offered but conjectures, ‘mihi‚ cuique,’ Bentl.; ‘medicumque‚'
Lachm.

ODE XXXIII.

‘Think not too much, Albius, of Glycera's faithlessness, nor write
piteous elegies about your rejection. It is the way always. Lycoris
pining sor Cyrus: Cyrus in love with Pholoe, who will as soon wed
him as a she-goat a wolf. This is merely Venus' crue} sport. I am
not exempt from the law!

The Ode is addressed to Albius Tibullus, the poet, to whom also
Horace wrote an Epistle (Ι. 4). Glycera is not one of the mistresses to
