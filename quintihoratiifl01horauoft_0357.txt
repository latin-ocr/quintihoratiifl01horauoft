NOTES. BOOK III, ODE Ill. 321

15. Quirinus. For the story of his translation see Ovid, Fast. 2.
481 foll.

Ἰ 17. The gods are represented as sitting in council on the question
whether Romulus shall be admitted to their number. Juno, to the
pleasure of all, assents.

18. Ilion, Ilion, ‘It was Troy that Ι hated, and Troy is destroyed.'

19. fatalis (cp. Δύσπαρις-Αἰνόπαρις), ‘doom—fraught.' The two
epithets are meant to have a close connection.

iudex, ‘ manet alta mente repostum Iudicium Paridis‚’ Virg. Aen. 1.
26. The epithet ⁴ incestus’ is fitly applied to him as ‘iudexj inasmuch
as his judgment was determined by 'Venus‘ promise, τὴν δ’ ᾑ’νησ’ ἥ οἱ
πόρε μαχλοσὺνην ἀλεγεινήν, Hom. Il. 24. 30.

20. mulier peregrina. There is a scornful emphasis in the manner
in which Juno refuses to name Helen or Paris.

vertit> in pulverem, reduced to dust, Gr. ἀμὰθὺνειν, as Hom. Il.
9· 593- η

21. ex quo, construet ‘ damnatum ex quo,’ etc. The sentence vras
passed at the time of Laomedon's sraud; it was executed in Priam's
time; so the ⁶ dux’ of v. 24 must be Laomedon. For the story of his
cheating Apollo and Neptune of their bargained wages for building the
walls of Troy see Hom. Il. 23. 442 foll.

22. mercede pacta, an abl. absol„ ‘promised them wages and then
sailed them'3 or it may be as Fore. takes it, after the analogy of the
ablative with ‘fraudare—‚² e. g. ‘ praeda‚' Liv. 2. 42.

mihi damnatum: ‘ ad<lictum,' given over for punishment, as Virg.
Aen. 4. 699 ‘Stygioque caput damnaverat Orco.' Bentley wished to
read ‘damnatam' against the MSS„ as ⁴ obsessam Ilion' is found in
Epod. 14. 14, and he is followed by Lachmann and Ritter. But we have
‘ Ilio superbo’ in Od. 1. 10. 14, and ‘ Ilion ' is a nom. in Ov. Met. 6. 95.

23. castae, ‘bene autem “castae,’' quia “incestus iudex’' dixerat)
Acr.

24. fraudulentam the epithetis meant for people and prince alike.
⁴ Laomedonteae periuria Troiae,' Virg. G. 1. 5023 cp. Aen. 4. 541.

25-28. Paris, the cause os the war, and Hector, the bulwark of Troy,
are dead.

2 5. adulterae, probably the dative with ‘ splendet,’ ‘ adorus himself
for the eyes of’ ; 1. 5. 4 ‘cui religas comam.' With ‘ splendet’ cp. Hom.
11. 3. 392 κάλλεΐ τε στίλβων καῖ εἵμασιν,

26. famosus, ‘infamous‚’ as in Sat. 1. 4. 5.

hospes, the relation that gave its chief infamy to Paris' crime, ᾔσχυνε
ξενίαν τράπεζαν κλοπαῖσι γυναικός, Aesch. Ag. 401.

28. refringit, breaks their onset, turns. ‘Danai . . decimum quos
distulit Hector in annum,’ V irg. Aen. 9. 154.
