do not) the use in this passage, and conjectured ‘numine‚’ which has
since been found in the Bern. MS.
Massicum; 1. 1. 19.

6. moveri, as in Epod. 13. 6 ‘vina . . move‚’ to disturb it, open
the bin.

7. descende, from the ‘apotheca,' where it was exposed to the smoke. ·

See on 3. 8. 10; similarly ‘ deripere horre0‚' 3. 28. 7.

8. promere, constr. after ‘ iubente)

languidiora, in a good sense, ‘mellower'; 3. 16. 35.

9. madet=‘ imbutus est'; but as Mr. Munro (on Lucr. 4. 792) ob-
serves, there is a play on the literal and metaphorical meaning. The
spongeis so full os philosophy that there might be supposed to be no
room sor the wine.

10. sermonibus, not merely the Dialogues of Plato and others in
which Socrates is an interlocutor, but talk on the same model.

negleget. The MSS. and the Schol. vary between the present and
future, with the usual additional variety between ‘negligere' and
‘neglegere' If not in this stanza, at least in the next one, ‘tu lene,’
ete. the particular cask has been generalised into the representative of
wine in its enlivening effects. The future helps to soften the transition.

horridus, ‘ he will not be so much of a cynic as to despise thee.'

11. Catonis, the censor. ‘Priscus’ is used of him almost as an
addition to his name; see Plut. Cat. Mai. 1. Cp. Epp. 2. 2.116 ‘priscis
memorata Catonibus? It has also been taken less well of ‘Cato Uti-
censis‚' ‘prisci ’ being interpreted ‘ old—fashioned,' ‘ stem.‘ Cic. pro Cael.
14 ‘ severe et graviter et prisce ageres

12. virtus Catonis, as Sat. 2. 1. 72 ‘ Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia
Laeli‚’ ⁴ Cato for all his virtue ’ς see on 1. 3. 36.

13. lene tormentum. The meaning seems to be settled by the
parallel Epp. 1. 5. 19 ‘ Fecundi calices quem non fecere disertum?’ As
the rack makes the unwilling witness speak freely, so wine makes the
wit which is usually stiff and taciturn become free and talkative, and
yet love the torture which is thus applied to it.

16. retegis Lyaeo. The name of ‘Lyaeus’ is used (as in Epod. -

9. 38 ‘curam metumque . . Dulci Lyaeo solvere ²) with reference to its
etymology, λύειν, so that the whole sentence is=‘arcana consilia rete-
gendo curas solvis.’ Cp. Epp. 1. 5. 16 ‘operta recludit.' ‘The cares
os grave people that seenied heavy burdens when brooded over alone,
seem subjects for mirth when confessed over wine.'

18. cornua, imit. by Ovid3 see above.. They are the symbol of
strength and of pugnacity, Ov. Am. 3. 11. 5 ‘venerunt capiti cornua sera

mero ’; perhaps also with allusion to the fact that Bacchus himself was
represented with homs, ταυρόκερως; see on Od. 2. 19. 29.
