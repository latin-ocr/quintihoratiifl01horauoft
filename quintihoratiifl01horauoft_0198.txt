162 HORA TJJ CARMJNUM

Line 1. See on 3. 29. 1 ⁸ Tyrrhena regum progenies.⁷ 113 neither case
is there the special purpose in the address which there is in Sat 1. 6. 1.
Compare Od. 1. 20. 5 with 3. 16. 20. It is, however, a little more than
a pleasing complirnent ; in connection with the next line it has the force
of ‘ so far above ns, yet whose power is my protection, and whose glory
is my pride? The Cilnii, Maecenas' ancestors on his father’s side, are
named (Liv. 10. 3) as a powerful family at Arretium in the fourth
century Bc.

atavis, ‘ancest01·s‚' cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 56 ‘Turnus avis atavisque potens!
&Vhen contrasted with other compounds of ⁶ avus‚’ ‘atavus,’=}n·[7ra⁷r⁷ros·‚
the fifth ancestor—‘ pater, avus, proavus, abavus, atavus,’ Plaut. Pers. 1.
2. 6.

edite, Virg. Aen. 8. 137 ‘ Electram maximus Atlas Edidit?

2. Cp. Od. 2. 17. 4 ‘mearum Grande decus columenque rerum ;' Ep.
1. 1. 103 · rernm tutela mearnm;' Virg. G. 2. 40 ‘O decus, O famae
merito pars maxima nostrae.’ Notice that here, as with the correspond-
ing word in the other passages, ‘ meum' is in the emphatic place, ‘ to me.’

3. sunt, quos . . iuvat. ⁶ Sunt qui’ may take either a Suly'mzctive, in
which case ‘ qui ’ has its consecutive force: ‘ sunt qui dicant! ‘there are
people to say z ’ or an laeale‘ratz‘zve, in which case ‘sunt—qui‚’ like ‘nescio
quis‚’ becomes a new pronoun, the subject os a definite categorical state-
ment, The former is the more Latin construction, more consonant with
the usages of the Relative. and is preferred in prose, although the
Indicative is also found, as in Sall. Cat. 19. 4, where see Kritz' note.
Horace„ swayed perhaps by his love of Greek constructions, prefers the
Indieative, after the model of εἰσὶν οῖ’. Cp. Od. 1. 7. 5, Sat. 1. 4. 24, 2,

1. 1, etc. But he uses the Subjunctive also, Sat. 1. 2. 28, 1. 4. 74, Epp. ' Α

1. 1. 77. ln Epp. 2. 2. 183 ‘Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat
haber& he seems to nse the two constructions as a means of contrasting
the vagueness of a general statement with the definiteness of a known
particular instance. ‘There are who have not, Ι know one who cares
not to have.'

curriculo may mean either the ‘ course,' as in Cic. Mur. 27' ‘quadri-
garum curriculum.y or the ‘chan-iot: as in Ov. Trist. 4. 8 ‘curriculo
gravis est sacta ruina meo.’

4. collegisse. On comparison with Sat. 1. 4. 31 ‘pulvis collectus
turbines perhaps rather ‘to have raised a cloud of dust ’ than ‘to have
become (lusty.’ The perf. may be regular, but see on 3. 4. 52.

fervidis, Vix-g. ti. 3. 167 ‘volat vi fervidus axis 3 ³ the object was to
round the ‘metae ' as closely as possible, and with the chariot going at
full speed.

5. palma nobilis, ‘the palm of glory‚’ Paus. 8. 48 ἐς δὲ τὴν δεξιάν
ἔστι καῖ π ῑνταχοῦ τῷ νικῶντι ἐστιθέμενος φοινΐξ.
