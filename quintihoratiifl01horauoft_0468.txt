432 HORA Tll CARMINA.

2. longe sonantem; 3. 30. 10 ⁴ qua violens obstrepit Aufidus‚' 4. 14.
25 foll„ Sat. 1. 1. 58.

3. non ante volgatas per artes: the plural, of the rules osan art.
⁴ Volgatas,' rather ‘ known to the world‚’ in its products, than ‘ divulged‘
as secrets to a special artist ; but there is intended to be a certain mystical
air about the words, a suggestion of the metaphor of 3. Ι. 2, 3 ‘carmina
non prius Audita musarum sacerdos‚' etc. The words qualify the whole
clause ‘quae natus ad Aufidum . . verba loquor,' etc.‚ ‘ verba socianda
chordis' being merely a periphrasis for lyrical poetry, and there being
the usual antithesis between his birth—place and his claim. Itis Latin
lyrie poetry which he professes to have invented, or popularized, as he
puts it, when he is speaking more responsibly in Epp. 1. 19 ‘Ostendi
Latio . . volgavi)

5. Maeonius; 1. 6. 2, the adjectiva] form of ‘ Maeonides? Tradition
was divided on the question whether Homer was so called as literally a
son of M aeon, or only as a Lydian.

6. latent, are hidden from sight, forgotten.

7. Oeae ; 2. 1. 38, the Muse of Simonides.

Alcaei minaces, the poems in which he attacked Myrsilus and other
tyrants of Mitylene. ‘ Pugnas et exactos tyrannos,' 2. 13. 30-32.

8. Stesichori graves Camenae. To us who do not possess his
poems, the epithet is best interpreted by Quintil. 10. 1. 62 ‘ Stesichorum
quam sit ingenio validus materiae quoque ostenderunt, maxima bella et
clarissimos canentem duces et epici carminis onera lyra sustinentem.
Reddit enim personis in agendo simul loquendoque debitam dignitatem.'

9. lusit, as παίζειν, of light and playful poetry. It contrasts with
the dignity of Stesichorus and the passion of Sappho, see on 1. 32· 2.

11. commissi, confided as secrets. Sat. 2. 1. 30 ‘ Ille velut fidis
arcana sodalibus olim Credebat libris.' ‘ She told her secret to the lute,
And yet its chords with passion thrill,' Conington.

12. Aeoliae; 2. 13. 24.

13 foll. Horace passes from the defence of lyric poetry as contrasted ἵ

with epic, to the power of verse generally. He employs a variety of

forms to express the centra] thought, viz. that the persons and deeds ⁴

which are Homer-'s theme, had their counterparts in the age before him,
as worthy of record as they, yet which all perished as though they had
never been. ‘Non sola‚⁷ ‘ primusve,' ‘non semel,' ‘non solus,' ‘non
primus.¹ Then the same thought is stated affirmatively in v. 25.

13—16. The construction is ‘non sola arsit crines, mirata et aurum
cultusque et comites,’ ‘que' coupling the things more closely connected,
