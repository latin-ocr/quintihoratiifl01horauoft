MA A'US C A‘JPT S. xxi

particularly perhaps to the unrivalled power, learning, and elo—
quence with which our greatest English scholar recommended
the method and its results in his edition of the poet. There
was something however in the nature of the critical evidence
on which Horace’s text rests which made conjectural emenda-
tion,- if not specially necessary, at least specially tempting.
Necessary of course it was not in the sense in which it is
necessary in the text of Aeschylus or of Lucretius, to restore
sense or metre in a chaos3 but in a way the multiplicity of
MSS. tempts us to do for one author what the poverty of MSS.
almost compels us to do sor another. A variety of readings,
all consistent with metre and intelligible‚ and all testing on
fairly equal MS. testimony, must imply the hand of one or
more emenders of the text at an early period. It is a natural
interpretation to assume in such a case that all alike are
attempts‚ more or less skilful, to fill up a gap in the original
authority 3 and this once believed, a scholar of the 16th or 17th
century may not unreasonably think himself as competent to
guess the riddle as a scholar of the 4th or 5th. It is manifest
that no impassable barrier separates cases where the MSS. are
divided from those where they are consentient. Division is
only a sign of the disease. We have already seen that it is
confessedly possible for the same blunder to infest every MS.
A modern editor will probably set aside, as a rule, purely con-
jectural emendations ; at any rate, he will hesitate to give them
the reality which is implied by printing them in the text ; not
because he denies the possibility of corruptions, or does not
feel the plausibility of many conjectures, but only because
experience has taught us that there is no necessary limit even
to the cleverest and most plausible guessing, and because it
cannot be proved that in such a text as that of Horace guessing
on a large scale is necessary. One more remark may be al-
lowed. An editor with the feelings which Ι have described
, will yet feel bound to recall, and to some extent to discuss, the
more famous conjectures which have become part of the literary
history of his author, and in doing so he will run the risk, at
times, of seeming to treat great names ungraciously. It must
