298 ΗΘΚΛ Tll CARMJNA.

26. lento risu, Cic. de Or. 2. 190 ‘lente serre'; Tac. Ann. 3. 70. 3
‘lentus in suo dolore esset!

29. Achilles had his choice; cp. Hom. ΙΙ. 9. 412 Εἷ μέν κ’ αὖθι μένων
Τρώων πόλιν ἀμφιμάχωμαι, Ὠλετο μέν μοι νόστος ἀτὰρ κλέος ἄφθιτον
ἔσται· Εἰ δέ κεν οἴκαδ’ ἵκωμι φίλην εἰ πατρίδα γαΐαν,”Ὠλετό μοι κλέος
ἐσθλὸν ἐπὶ δηρὸν δέ μοι αἰὼν Ἔσσεται.

30: longa, antith. to ‘ eita,' v. 29. Mimnermus 4 (ed. Bergk) Τιθωνῷ
μὲν ἔδωκεν ἔχειν κακὸν ἄφθιτον ὁ Ζεύς, Γῆρας, ὃ καὶ θανάτου ῥίγιον
ἀργαλέου.

32. hora. Time in its course, one hour ifnot another ; cp. 4. 7. 8. Ritter
takes ‘tibi quod negarit' of lise, as though it meant ‘I may perhaps
survive you.y But a more general sentiment is a better introduction to
the next two stanzas; and it is the broad equality of men's lots that is
in point, so that ‘ mihi porriget tibi quod negarit ' would seem naturally
to imply the converse also, that Grosphus will have what Horace
has not. ⁷

33. Grosphus has large pas-tures in Sicily. For this form of wealth
see on 1. 31. 5. Cp. Epod. 1. 27, Epp. 2. 2117.

33, 34. greges . . mugiunt. If ‘greges ¹ is to be distinguished from
·vaccae‚’ according to the common opposition of ⁶ greges et armenta,'
‘flocks and herds‚’ there is an easy zeugma in the use of ‘mugiunt.'
Possibly, however, ‘ greges vaccaeque ³ = ¹ greges vaccarum ’ (cp. Epod.
2. 11 ‘mugientium greges ’)‚ the two being separated in order to give
more emphasis to the numeral and adjective.

34. For the elision cp. 4. 2. 22, Carm. S. 47.

35. bis tinctae, διβαφα, Epod. 12. 21 ‘Muricibus Tyriis iteratae
vellera lanae!

Afro, Epp. 2. 2. 181 ‘ vestes Gaetulo murice tinctas!

38. spiritum Camenae, equivalent‚ as the commentators say, to the
ἴσα πνεῖν Μούσαις of the epigram on Sappho (Anal. Brunck. p. 449) save
that ‘ spirare' and ‘ spiritus’ have a special reference, which we do not
know in πνεῖν, to the ‘thoughts that breathe and words that bum’ οἱ
poetry. Cp. Od. 4. 3. ²4 ‘Quod spiro et placeo, si placeo, tuum est‚'
4. 6. 29 ‘Spiritum Phoebus mihi, Phoebus artem Carminis nomenque
dedit poetae.’ See also Sat. 1. 4. 42—47, where the name of poet is
limited to the man, ⁶ Ingenium cui sit, cui mens divinior atque 05 Magna
sonaturum,’ and it is doubted whether comedy can claim to be poetry‚
⁵ quod acer spiritus ac vis Nec verbis nec rebus inest.’

tenuem has no doubt a close relation to ‘ Graiae‚' and describes the
polish and refinement of taste which Horace miss-ed irs the earlier Roman
literature. Cp. A. P. 323, where there is the same antithesis as that
hinted here between the delicacy of literary taste and the coarser Roman
life with its love of wealth, ‘ Graiis ingenium,’ etc. It is difficult to say
