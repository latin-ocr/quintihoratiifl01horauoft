dependent of the suture; he has had the delight which cannot now be
taken from him.

47. diffinget, ‘alter’; see on 1. 35. 39. For the sentiment cp.
Agathou in Ar. Eth. N. 6. 2 μόνου ’γὰρ αὐτοῦ καὶ θεὸς στερίσκεται ἀγένητα
ποιεῖν ἅσσ’ ἂν ᾖ πεπραγμένα.

48. vexit, probably best, with Ritter, ‘has brought'; Virg. G. 1.
461 ‘quid vesper serus vehat.' ‘ Semel‘ is to be taken with ‘vexit‚'
the hour flies, but what it has brought abides for ever. Orelli makes
‘ vexit ’ =¹ avexit-¹

50. ludum; 2. 1. 3 ‘ ludum Fortunae.’

54. resigno. Festus vouehes for the use of ‘ resignare ' as: ‘ rescri-
bere'3 and ‘rescribere' as we see from Sat. 2. 3. 75 (cp. the opp. ‘scribe,'
ibid. 69), had the sense of ‘to pay back‚’ ‘to cancel a bond by payment.'
Horace uses the same word again in Epp. Ι. 7. 34 ‘Hac ego 51 com-
pellar imagine cuncta resigno ’3 but no other Roman writer is quoted
for this use of it, which has passed into modern languages.

55. virtute me involvo. He has given up the externa] gifts of
Fortune; so far he is ‘nudus’ (3. 16. 23), but she cannot rob him oi
what 15 intemal‚ and 5ο 1115 own. The expression is parallel to Plato's
ἀρετὴν ἀντὶ ἱματίων ἀμφιέσονται of the women of his state, Rep. 5.
P· 457 Α·

56. quaero, seek as my bride.

58. miseras, ‘abject'; Juv. 3. 276 ‘ votum miserabile!

59. decurrere ; Virg. Aen. 5. 782 ⁶ preces descendere ad omnes,’ Hdt.
1. Ι Ιόγκαταβαίνειν εἷς λιτάς.

62. biremis, not a ship with two banks of oars, but=⁴duorum scal·
morum navicula,’ Cic. ad Att. 10. 10. 5, a little two-oared boat attached
to a larger vessel. The two stanzas are metaphorical. ‘ If my fortune
fails me, Ι am not like the merchant who in a shipwreck wastes 1115 time
in abject prayers for his cargo3 Ι can get ashore with all I care for?

64. geminus Pollux. ‘Pollux, the twin-brother‚’ is as much as
to say, ⁴ Pollux, with 1115 twin-brother Castor! Cp. 1. 3. 2, 1. 12. 25,

4. 8. 31.
ODE XXX.

‘The task 15 done; the monument is built which will immortalise
my name. While Rome stands men will tell how one born by the
Aufidus rose from a humble rank to greatness: the first Roman lyric

, poet. Melpomene, give me the crown which I have earned'
