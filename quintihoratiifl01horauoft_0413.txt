business, for it never can keep pace with desire?

The Ode travels over the same ground as Odes 1-6 of this Book, which
seem in sact expansions of texts from this one. It must have been written
about the same time, though probably before them. We-may note also
how many of its expressions recur in the Odes (especially 5 and 15) of
Book iv, which celebrate Augustus' acts as accomplished.

4. †·1·y1·rhenum‚ †Apulicum. So Ι have printed, not from any con-
fidence in the text, but rather because, in default of conclusive evidence on
the subject, this reading seems to have acquired a certain right of pos-
session from the favour of several generations of editors. ⁶ Apulicum '
has but slight MS. authority ; it does not explain the variants, and there
is the difficulty of the quantity of its first syllable, which is never sound
certainly short, unless 1n the disputed passage in Od. 5. 4. 10. The chief
var. lect. are (1) ‘ Ponticum‚’ which is found in B, A, and λ, and is ac-
cepted by Ritter. Keller thinks it a ‘ Mavortian' alteration. The whole
expression would then mean, ‘the sea from end to end of the civilized
world, from Rome to the Euxine.’ (2) ‘ publicum,’ which was the read-
ing of V, and is found in π, τ, γ. It must mean ‘the common property
of all,' as in Ov. Met. 6. 351 ‘ usus communis aquarum est. Nec solem
proprium Natura nec aera fecit, Nec tenues undas; ad publica munera
veni.' The difficulty in its way is that it seems to carry with it the
necessity for the alteration of ‘Tyrrhenum.' No local name will corre-
spond to it. Lachmann (on Lucr. 1. 360) conjectured ⁶ terrenum‚' which
occurs in the sense of‘ land ’ in Liv. 23· 19, and Keller and Mr. Munro
(though the latter grudgingly) accept it. The name ⁴ Tyrrhenum’ ap-
pears as ⁶ Tirrenum ' in several good MSS„ though this is not inore mis·-
spelling than is to be looked for with proper names. The Schol. of
Aer. and Porph. is favourable to the conj. though it does not require it:
⁶ invehitur in luxuriam omnia profanantem et aedificiis novis non terram
tantum sed etiam maria occupantem.’ The full expression would then
be, ‘ Every inch of dry land and the sea is the common heritage of all.’
