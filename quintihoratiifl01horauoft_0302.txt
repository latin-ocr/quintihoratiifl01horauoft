266 HORA TJJ CARMJNA.

6. remoto, ‘retii-ed) ‘quiet’; cp. Epod. 2. 23—28.‘

per dies festos, ‘per' might denote either ‘through the entire day’
as ‘per brumam,’ Epp. 1. 11. 19, or ⁶ on each holiday‚' as ‘per exactos
annos‚' Od. 3. 22. 6. It is opposed to the life of unbroken sadness
(⁶ omni tempore '), and means ‘miss no opportunity of merriment.’

8. interiore nota, the brand of the innermost, and so the earliest-
filled bin. The ‘amphora’ itself was branded or a label was attached
to it with the name of the wine and of the consul in whose year it
was bottled3 ‘patriam titulumque,’ Juv. S. 5. 33. Cp. ‘nota Falerni,’
Sat. 1. 10. 24.

9—1 1. quo . . quid, ‘ to what purpose? why?’ ‘to what purpose but
that you may make merry in the shade?' Dillr. quotes, sor the change
of conjunction, Ov. Met. 13. 516 ‘Quo ferrea resto? Quidve moror?'
This is the reading of the oldest MSS„ including V and B. A large
number have *quo . . quo,' in which case the two clauses must be
written without a note of question, as ‘quo' will answer to ‘huc,’ ‘hither
to the spot to which the boughs stretch out and to which the stream is in
such haste to hurry down.' The lemma in the MSS. of Porph. has in the
second place ‘ quo,¹ but whatever he read, he interpreted it ‘whe1·efore‘?'
sor he writes ‘subaudiendum si ea non utimur.’ It must be allowed
that this· possibility of a double interpretation is in favour of ‘quo.’
Keller edits ‘quo et,' which Bentley found in some MSS. The hiatus,
if we retain ‘quo‚' must be classed with Epod. 5. 100.

9. alba, as ‘candida populus.’ Virg. E. 9. 41. The double contrast
between the slighter poplar white in the wind and the gloom of the
heavier pine is indicated, aster Horace's manner, by one epithet with
each of the pair of substantives‚ see on 3. 4. 46, 47, 3. 13. 7, 4. 4. 10.
For his notice of colour cp. Od. 1. 21. 7, 8 ‘Nigris aut Erymanthi
Silvis aut viridis Cragi ’; 1. 25. 17, 18 ‘ hedera virente . . pulla myrto.’

10. hospitalem, Virg. G. 4. 24 ‘Obviaque hospitiis teneat frondenti-
bus arbos.’

amant, rather on account of the charm of the place or for the
pleasure of shading the revellers, than <as Orelli takes it) as though the
boughs themselves were lovers, aster the image of ‘lascivae hederae,'
1. 36. 20. ‘Amare’ is used by Horace and other Graecising Latin
writers in imitation of φιλεῖν, but it rareiy, if ever, attains the colourless
or unconsciously idiomatic force of the original.

11. laborat trepidare, App. 2, ᾗ 1, *srets in its haste to escape
down its tortuous channel.' Contrast the water which (Epp. Ι. 10. 21)
⁴ per pronum trepidat cum murmure rivum.’

13. breves, accusative; Od. 1. 56. 16 ‘breve lilium.’ Here the epithet
is in point, sor the roses are types of the pleasures of life that must be
snatched quickly, so that it has the force of ‘ere they be withered:
