NOTES. BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE XXVII. 387

Line 1. parrae. Probably the common 0wl‚ still called in local Italian
dialects ‘parruzza.'

recinentis, repeating its note; 1. 12. 3v Epp. 1. 1. 55.

2. ducat, πέμποι, ‘go with them on their way,' i.e. attend their setting
forth. The talk is of ἐνόδιοι σύμβολοι, Aesch. P. V. 487.

3. rava, ‘ ravus color dicitur niger mixtus cum fulvo,' Aer.

decurrens Lanuvino. Lanuvium, now Civita Lavigna, was on a
hill about a mile to the right of the Via Appia (cp. Cic. pro Mil. c. 10),
by which Galatea is starting, like Horace in Sat. 1. 5, for Brundisium

, and the passage to Greece.

5. rumpat et. There is no inconsistency, as Bentley objects‚ between
the wishes of the first and second stanzas. They are really alternatives,
though put, after a common fashion, conjunctively, like the Homeric
εἴθ’ ὄφελες ἄγονός τ’ ἔμεναι ἄγαμός τ’ ἀπολέσθαι ; see on 3. 11. 49. ‘ Let
evil omens attend the setting forth, or stop the journey of the wicked.’
Both things may happen to thern, though not to the same people on
the same occasion. ‘ Ι,’ he continues, ‘ ifwith my knowledge of augury
Ι am anxious for a friend, will at least do my best to procure good
omens for her. Go, Galatea, where you like best, and good omens
go with you.' Mr. Munro follows Bentley in adopting the reading
‘rumpit‚’ which is found in a few MSS. of value. This alteration
gives a different colour to the whole passage. All three stanzas will
then, though under varied forms, be really direct statements of the
omens which stop. or ought to stop, persons from setting out on a
journey. ‘ Only those who think nothing of religion would start in spite
of the hooting of an owl (the form is optative or permissive, ‘let the
omen of an owl‚ etc. go with the wicked ³) : even if the journey is begun,
it is broken off isa snake darts across the road: I shall pray, when Ι am
anxious for a friend's safety, sor the omen of a croaking crow in the
east, instead of that of the raven flying away to the pools.’ The transi-
tion from this to stanza 4 is very awkward‚ unless, with Bentley and
Munro, we complete the sense by adopting‚ in v. 15, the conjecture of
Lambinus, ‘vetat'3 so that will mean, ‘in your case, Galatea, there
are none of these bad omens.' The ‘que' in v. 15 is awkward in that
case, and the direct enumeration of the omens must have owed its point,
isit had any, to circumstances which we do not know.

7. cui timebo, ‘for one for whom'3 the dative has to do double
duty. ⁶ Cui ' is the reading of the Bland. Vet. and the other best MSS:
it was corrupted to ⁶ cur,' and then to ‘ quid.’

8. providus auspex. He will not only wait for the omens and
*judge them when they come, but will look sorward to them, and try to
procure good ones,

10. imbrium divina'avis, as 3. ¹7. 12 ‘aquae augur annosa cornix‚’
