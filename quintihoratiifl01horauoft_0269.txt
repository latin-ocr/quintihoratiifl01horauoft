NOTES. BOOKJ, ODE XXVIII. 233

21. devexi Orionis. Orion's setting is a time proverbial for bad
weather, Od. 3. 27. 18, Epod. 15. 7, Virg. Aen. 7. 719.

comes, Od. 4. 12. 1.

22. Illyricis, sor the Adriatic generally, as Virg. Aen. 1. ²43·

23. at tu answers, perhaps, the emphatic ‘te' of v. 1, ‘Yon have
leetured me, now hear what Ι have to say to you?

ne parce malignus, ‘grudge not churlishly.' He puts it as though
avarice could be the only reason for his refusing.

vagae adds a touch, ⁶ surely the saud· that drives hither and thither
before the wind won't eost you much.’ It is time, however, rather than
saud, that he doubts his sparing; ‘parce dare ' as ‘parce cavere,' Od.
3. 8. 26.

24. For the hiatus cp. Epod. 13. 4 ‘Threicio Aquilone'; Virgil's
⁴ Actaeo Aracyntho‚' Ecl. 2. 24 etc.

25. sic, i. e. if you do as I ask; see 011 Od. 1. 3. 1.

quodcunque minabitur, for the personification cp. Virg. G. Ι. 462
¹ quid cogitet Auster?

26. fluetibus Hesperiis. Does this mean ‘on the other side of
Italy when you get round there‚' ‘ may the east wind spend its soree on
the forests of Apulia as it crosses Italy'? οι· do the words not neces-
sarily imply that the trader will himself be sailing on the Hesperian
waves? The east wind is on an errand of vengeance against the waves
of the west, it is dangerous to come in his course. The form of expres-
sion is dictated by the love of verbal antithesis, but there is the notiori
of the wind sweeping‚ or threatening to sweep, isit be not stayed by
Archytas' prayer, from one end of heaven to the other. As the trader is
already east of Italy, he would more probably be sailing to the east than,
like the ‘mercator’ of Ι. 31. 14, to the Spanish ports outside the Straits.

27. plectantur, in its usual sense not only of being lashed, but of
bearing the punishment ; ‘ may all his vengeanee be wreaked on them!

multa merces, ‘ a rich reward‚’ i. e. sor your humanity.

28. unde potest, Ι cannot reward you. but there is that which will,

the favour of Jove, who (as originally in his function of ξένιος) presides
especially over the reciprocal duties of men to one another, and of
Neptune the tutelary god of Tarentum, who will remember kindness
shown to a citizen of his own. For ‘unde' ofa person, see on Od. Ι.
1 2. 17.
ι 30, 31. ‘Art thou careless of committing a crime that shall bring
punishment presently on thine innocent children ¹? May-be even in thine
own person the debt of justice and a retum of eontumely may be in
store for thee’

te natis, to be 'taken together. ‘ te' being the amative, as in ‘ nate
-Deaff ‘Apolline natus,' etc. : the opposition is to ‘ te ipsum.’ ⁴ Te ’ has
