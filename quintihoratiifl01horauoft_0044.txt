8 INTRODUCTION TO THE

date of Tiridates' flight. Two of the Odes which refer to this
event (3. 8 and 29) speak also of Maecenas as burdened with
cares of State in a way in which no other Ode speaks of him.
‘ Mitte civiles super urbe curas,' ‘ Tu civitatem quis deceat
status Curas, et urbi sollicitus times.’ These expressions have
been usually interpreted of the powers which Augustus is known
to have delegated to Maecenas during his own absence from
Rome in the last year of the civil war. Dio 51. 3, Tac. Ann. 6.
1 1 ‘Augustus bellis civilibus Cilnium Maecenatem equestris
ordinis cunctis apud Romam atque Italiam praeposuit.' If the
later date of these Odes were adopted it would seem necessary
to assume, what is probable enough in itself, but not otherwise
ascertained, that the same powers were entrusted to Maecenas
during Augustus' absence in Gaul and Spain in the years B.C.

27-24.

II.——THE ORDER OF THE ODEs.

ᾧ 9. IN the preceding pages it has been assumed that the
first three Books of the Odes were published together. This
is not a necessary inference from Suetonius' words3 all that
we know from him being that three Books had been pub-
lished before the fourth was commenced. But if we may
assume that the present division of Odes between the Books
is the original division, it will follow that the publication of
the three must have been simultaneous, not successive, for,
whatever be the principle of the arrangement of the Books, it
certainly is not chronological ¹. For this reason, then, if for
no other, it may be a matter of some interest to see the
evidence in favour of the present order of the Odes.

ᾗ 10. In the first place, it has at least the right of undisputed
traditional possession. One MS. indeed, and that the im-

1 We have seen that Ι. 24 dates from the same year as 3. 143 1. 12
seems to be one of the latest, 3. 29 one of the earliest Odes; 1. 32 is
most plausibly associated with 3. 1-63 1. 26 ranges itself with 3. 8, and
this again is certainly prior to 1. 20.
