19. ruinis, ‘shocks,' as of an earthquake. ⁷

20. indomitas, ‘tameless.’ The simile is double: the freedom and
obstinacy of the waters, the fierce rushes and persistence of the south
wind. We need not press the epithet to a contradiction, as Bentley’s
too logical criticism does, as though it would require that Tiberius
should not have conquered the Raeti. He would read (and one MS.
supports him) ‘ indomitus.’ The simile depends grammatically on what
follows, the construction being ‘qualis Auster exercet undas [ita . . tali
modo] impiger hostium vexare turmas,' ‘impiger,’ etc„ grammatically
again, qualifying ‘fatigaret.’

22. scindente nubes, ‘when they shine through the tom clouds.‘
The expression combines, in a vague way, the ideas of the dale, ‘ when
Pleiads are specially noticeable' (the time meant may be near either
equin0x; see Dict. Ant. Pleiades, s. v. Astronomia), and of stormy
wealller, ‘when the sky is full of brol-:en clouds? Orelli takes ‘scin-
dente' of their opening the clouds, i.e. letting the rain sall.

23. vexare3 3. 2. 3. For inf. see App. 2, ξ 2.

24. per igneS. Bentley, as usual, is sar better than his critics. His
way out of the difficulty, by substituting conjecturally ‘ enses,' is not one
in which we can follow him. But he disposeS‚ in advance, of all the
parallels which are still quoted on the view that the expression is meta-
phorical z ‘per medium ardorem pugnae,’ Corn. Cruq. One class, such
as Virgil’s ‘medias acies mediosque per ignes) Aen. 7. 296, indicate the
direct opposite, sor they refer to the literal fires of Troy; and Silius'
imitations (14. 175 and 15. 41) are just the same—the fires are as literal
as the swords. The other class, such as Horaee's own ‘per mare . .
per saxa, per ignes,7 Epp. 1. 1. 43, ‘ignes Per medios fluviosque ruentis‚’
Sat. 2. 3. 56, establish the proverbial use of ‘fire‚’ as one among
many metaphors of extreme dangers or obstacles; but do not parallel
the substitution of ‘to ride his horse through the middle of the fire‚’ for
‘through the hottest fight? We have gone too far in the sentence with
unmetaphorical lmguage, to tolerate being pulled up suddenly by a
bold metaphor. The tires may well be the burning villages of the
Raeti through which Tiberius forced his way.
