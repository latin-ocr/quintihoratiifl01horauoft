HORATII, EPODON LIBER.

EPODE Ι.

‘You‚ Maecenas, are going to expose yourself to all the dangers of
war for Caesar's sake—what think you Ι shall do, to whom you are as
much as Caesar can be to you? Ι shall follow you to the world's end.
Do you ask what good Ι can do ⁴? Ι shall be in less terror if 1 am with
you than if Ι am absent. I have no selfish motive. Your bounty has
made me rich enough already. Ι don't want more either to hoard or to

squander.’

This Epode is usually referred (after the Scholiast) to the spring of
buc. 31, when Augustus, according to Dio (50. 11), before setting out to
Actium, summoned the chief men of Rome, senators and equites, to meet
him at Brundisium ε τοὺς μὲν ὅπως τι συμπράξωσιν αὐτῷ, τοὺς δ’ ὅπως μηδὲν
μονωθέντες νεοχμὼσωσι, τό τε μέγιστον ὅπως ἐνδείξηται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ὅτι
καὶ τὸ πλεῖστον καὶ τὸ κράτιστον τῶν Ῥωμαίων ὁμογνωμονοῦν ἔχοι. It
would be probable that Maecenas would go with the rest, although he
must have returned to Rome and not gone on to Actium, as Dio (51. 3)
speaks of his having been left in charge of Rome and Italy during the
campaign. Mr.Dyer‚ however (in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p. 20 foll„
and in the Dict. Biog. s. v. Maecenas), argues strongly for the view that
the Epode belongs to the war against Sextus Pompeius in the year ΒΕ. 36,
when there is reason (Appiam, de Bell. Civ. 5. p. 729) to believe that
Maecenas was in Sicily with Octavianus. He thinks that Horace actually
accompanied him as he proposes to do, and that the otherwise un-
identified escape from shipwreck in the poet's life (⁴ Sicula Palinurus
unda,' Od. 3. 4. 28 q. v.) belongs to this expedition.

Line 1. Liburnis, Od. 1. 37. 30, ships of a light build, modelled
on the piratical vessels of the Liburni, a tribe on the Illyrian coast.
They were the strength of Octavianus' fleet at Actium. Those who?
maintain the Sicilian reference of the Epode quote Appiam, l. c.‚ where
Liburnian galleys are named among the ships of Octavianus which were
lost in a storm during a campaign against Sextus Pompeius.

2. alta propugnacula. If the scene is Actium, these are the wooden
towers (Plut. Ant. 66) on Antony's ships. Virg. Aen. 8. 691 ‘pelago
credas innare revolsas Cycladas aut montes concurrere montibus altos:
Tanta mole viri turritis puppibus instant?

4. tuo, sc. ‘periculo ’ ; ‘ at your own periL'

5e si superstite. This was read by Por-ph„ who notices the difficulty
