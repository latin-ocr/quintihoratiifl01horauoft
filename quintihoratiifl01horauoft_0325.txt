NOTES. BOOK ll, ODE mss. 289

the Parthian is said to trust to, Virg. G. 3. 31 ‘Fidentenrque fuga
Parthum versisque sagittis‚' ‘ arrows of the swistly flying Parthian.' Cp.
Od. 1. 19. 11 ‘ Versis animosum equis!

18. catenas et Italum robur, ‘the chains of an Italian prison—house.'
³ Robur ' was a name given to the ‘ Tullianum ’ or lower dungeon of the
Mamertine prison by the Capitol, where greater criminals were confined
before their execution (it is described in Sall. Cat. 55), and where
jugurtha was starved to death (Plut. Marius 12). The conjunction
‘catenas et robur' makes this meaning inevitable, as in Lucr. 5. 1030
‘verbera, carnifices, robur, pix ’ ; Tac. Ann. 4. 29 ‘ robur et saxum mini-
tari.' Dill‘. would take it in the simple sense os ‘the strength of Italy)

19. improvisa, predicative.

20. rapuit rapietque, Od. 4. 2. 38 ‘nihil maius donavere nec dabunt’:
Epp. 1. 2. 43 ‘labitur et labetur‘; 1. 7. 21 ‘tulit et feret.’

gentes, used for ‘mankind ' as in 1. 3. 28 ‘ignem gentibus intulit';
but specially appropriate here as Horace has been enumerating several
nations who differ in their special fears, but all sall under this one
sentence.

21. furvae, a word meaning apparently ‘ dark‚' appropriated in use
to the lower world and what belongs to it, the black victims sacrificed
to the ‘Di inseri,⁷ ete, Fest. s. v., A. Gell. 1. 18.

Proserpinae. This is the only place, except Sen. Herc. Fur. 548,
in which the first syllable is shortened. Horace has it long elsewhere,
Od. Ι. 28. 20, Sat. 2. 5. 110.

22. Aeaeum, one of the three judges os Hades, Ov. Met. 13. 25,
Plat. Gorg. p. 353.

23. discriptas. The MSS. vary between this reading, ‘descriptas‘
and ‘discretas.' The meaning is the same. Virg. Aen. S. 670 ‘secretos-
que pios!

²4· Aeoliis, Od. 4. 9. 12 ‘Commissi calores Aeoliae fidibus puellae.‘

25 foll. The lyric poet would look first in the shadow-world for
Sappho and Alcaeus, as Socrates (Plat. Apol. p. 41) imagines himself
looking for Palamedes and Ajax and other victims of unjust judgmentS.

puellis de popularibus, ‘ quod sibi non in amore responderent‚' as
in Sapph. Fr. 43, etc.

26. sonantem, with accusative : so it is used in the passive, Epod. ¹7-
40 ‘sonari voles.’

aureo plectro. ΦόρμιὙὙ’ Ἀπόλλων ἑπτάγλωσσον χρυσέῳ πλήκτρῳ
διώκων, Pind. N. 5. 24· For ‘plectro’ see on 2. 1. 40. The ‘golden
plectrum' is significant of the value of the poems. Cp. Quintil. 10. 1.
63 ‘Alcaeus in parte operis aureo plectro merito donatus qua tyrannos
insectatus multum etiam moribus confert‚' ete. On the subjects of his
poems see Od. 1. 32(
