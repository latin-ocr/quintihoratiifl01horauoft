specially appropriate here as having been used in solemn formulae, as
when Ζεὺς ὅρκιος was called to witness treaties or vows.

ODE ΙΙΙ.

‘De Juslz'tz'a et Constant2·a.’ Fz'rmness of pmssose is characterized
in vv. 108. It is the virtue by which Pollux and Hercules, and Augustus
and Bacchus, rose to heaven, by which Romulus overcame the opposition
of Juno, and won immortality for himself and world-wide empire for
Rome. justice is not absent from the early stanzas of the Ode, for it is
a just as well as a firm purpose which is glorified in them3 but it is the
key-note of Juno‘s speech, vv. 18-68. She yields to the persevering pur-
pose os Romulus and of Rome. Her wrath was against the ‘periura
Priami domus,’ the ‘ unjust judge‚’ v. 19, the promise-breaker, v. 22, the ’
violator of the laws of hospitality and of marriage, v. 25. They have
been punished, and she is satisfied. As long as beasts of the field hide
their whelps on the tombs of Priam and Paris, the Capitol may stand in
its glory. Rome may extend her sway over the world, only let her leave
gold in the mine, send her citizens to the world’s end in search of empire,
not of treasure. And let her beware above all things of the dream of

rebuilding the doomed city os Troy. Troy rebuilt, Juno’s wrath will
revive, and the second fall shall be as bad as the first.

The meaning of the last warning is not clear. Suetonius (Jul. C. 79)
mentions among the various causes of Julius Caesar's unpopularity a
rumour ‘migraturum Alexandriam (a town in the Troad) vel Ilium
translatis simul opibus imperii exhaustaque Italia delectibus et pro-
curatione urbium amicis permissa.’ It has been suggested that this
idea imputed to Caesar, and eventually carried out by Constantine, may
have been in men’s minds, and that Horace, possibly at the inspiration
of Augustus, sets himself to discourage it. His protest, however, is an
empty one. The mythological argument could not be serious, and no
other is brought sorward. Dillenburger, with more likelihood, imagines
