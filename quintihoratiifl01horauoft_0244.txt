208 HORA Tll CARMIAM.

But Bentley shows conclusively that even if the Romans had used
‘haedilia’ rather than ‘caprilia' (Varr. R. R. 2. 3. 8, as they use
⁴ ovile,’ not ‘agnile W, it would be the plural of ‘haedile' with the ί
long and the α short. Bentley himself defends the suggestion of
‘ haeduleae,' ‘kids' (Auratus had conj. ‘ haedulei' following the analogy
of ‘equuleus,' ‘equula,' ¹ hinnuleus'). We have to weigh the pro-
bability of such an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον against the probability of the name
of some wood or hill near the farm being otherwise unknown to us.

10. uteunque, temporal‚ as always in Hor. Od. 1. 55. 23, 2. 17. 11,
3. 4. 29, 4. 4. 35, Epod. 17. 52; here, as in Od. 4. 4. 35, it means ‘so
soon ass .

fistula, the pipe of Faunus. ‘ Pan primus calamos cera coniungere
plures Instituit,' Virg. E. 2. 32.

1 1. cubantia the meaning os the epithet cannot be certainly known
till we are sure what ‘Ustica' waS, which it qualifies. Is it ‘low—
lying‚' of a valley, or some spot in a valley; Theoc. 13. 40 ἡμένῳ ἐν
χὼρῳῗ) or ‘ sloping‚' of a hill-side, Virgil's ¹ colles supini ’; Lucretius',
4. 528, ‘ cubantia tecta'?

13. di me tuentur. He sums up the previous stanzas. The
thought was apparently at first only the beauty of Lucretilis which
draws Faunus even from Arcadia3 but it has passed into the wider
idea that the Farm and its owner are under the special protection of
heaven.

14. hie. The great majority of MSS. have ‘ hinc,' and we must add
Aer. and Porph.‚ who interpret ‘scilicet de Sabino fundo.' But ‘hic’
and ‘hinc’ (hc) are often confused, as in Od. 1. 21. 13, where B has

'‘ hinc' against the clear sense. And the balance of the three promises,
country pleasures, music, and good wine without quarrelling, perhaps
justifies the almost unanimous preference given by the editors to ‘hic.’

14-16. The construction is ‘ copia, ruris honorum opulenta, benigno
cornu manabit tibi ad plenum.‘ ‘Plenty‚ rich in all the pride of the
country, shall stream from her bounteous horn into thy lap till it is fullfl

15. ad plenum, adverbially, as in Virg. G. 2. 244 ‘ Huc ager ille
malus dulcesque a sontibus undae Ad plenum calcentur.'

16. honorum = ‘ omnium quibus honestatur rus,' Orelli3 i. e. flowers,
fruits, etc. S. 2. 5. 12 ‘dulcia poma Et quoscunque feret cultus tibi
fundus honores? So leaves are ‘silvae honor,’ Epod. 11. 6, Virg. G.
2. 404.

cornu, the horn of plenty. Ovid gives two forms of legend. In
Fast. 5. 115 it is the broken horn of a goat which Amalthaea filled
with fruit for the infant Jupiter. In Met. 9. 85 soll. it is the horn which
Hercules broke from the forehead of Achelous, and which the Naiads

filled for Plenty, ‘ pomis et odoro flore.'
