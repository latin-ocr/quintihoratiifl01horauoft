6. illis, sc. ‘sonantibus‚' as· though the construction had bet-n ‘sonan-
tibus mixtum carmen tibiis et lyra?

barbarum, used instead of‘ Phrygium ' for the sake of the antithesis
to ‘ Dorium.' The Phrygian mode and its appropriate instrument be-
long rather to orgics and revclry (Od. 3. 19. 16), the Dorian to martial
music. This occasion calls sor both.

7. nuper. Five years before, when Sextus Pompeius (in Sept. ac.
36) was totally defeated hy Agrippa oss Naulochus in Sicily, and driven
from the sca to take refuge in Asia.

Neptunius; he called himself the son of Neptune and the sea,
Appian 5. 100, Dio C. 48. 19. In the same chapter Dio speaks of the
multitude of runaway slaves who joined his fleet, cp. Epod. 4. 19.

10. servis, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘detraxerat ⁷ and ‘amicus,’ see on Od. 1.

11. posteri negabitis. Cp. Od. 2. ¹9· 11 ‘credite‚ posteri‚' of some-
thing strange.

12. emancipatus, ‘ sold as a slave? Cic. Phil: 2. 21 ‘venditum
atque emancipatum tribunatum,' Plaut. Bacch. 1. 1. 5«) ‘Nunc mulier
tibi me emancipo; tuus sum, tibi operam do.‘ ‘ Emancipare' abs. is
‘to free from ⁴⁴ mancipium‚” ’ with a (lat. it came to mean 'to transfer
from one ‘⁵ mancipium '’ to another) ‘to sell.'

13. sert vallum et, arma, i.e. ‘ is a Roman soldier still in discipline
and endurance.’ Compare Cicero's account of what a soldier carried on
his march, Tusc. 2. 16 ‘ Militiae nostri exercitus qui labor et quantus
agminis, ferre plus dimidiati mensis eiba1·ia.ferre si quid ad usum velint,
ferre vallum! Nam scutum, galeam, gladium, in onere nostri milites
non plus numerant quam humeros, lacertos, manus ; arma enim membra
militis esse dicunt.⁷ ‘ Vallus ’ is a stake for palisading.

et spadonibus, see on Od. 1. 37. 9. ⁶ Et ' from the context acquires
the force of ‘ et tamen.'

14. potest. in the sense of τλῆναι, see on Od. 3. 11. 31.

16. sol adspicit, a trope common to all nations‚ ‘before all Israel
and before the sun.’

conopium, a gauze curtain or tent to keep off mosquitoes. The
Romans despised it as a sign of effeminaey; see Paley on Prop. 4. 11.
45 ‘ Foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere saxo! Probably there is a
special emphasis of scorn on the foreign name, as in Juvenal's ‘ Rusticus
ille tuus sumit trechedipna, Quirine, Et ceromatico fert niceteria coilo.’

17. ad hune frementes, ‘ chating at such a sight ⁷ ; ‘ hunc’= ‘ mili-
tem spadonibus servientem.’ Compare perhaps the use of ‘ hic ’ in Od.
3. 5. 37. It has also been taken (like ‘hostis' and ‘ille' in 27, 29) of
Antonius, whose name Horace avoids (see Introd. to Od. Ι. 37), but
who is sufficiently indicated in the soregoing verses, For the construc-
