Introduction. In the matter of orthography I have followed

hints from friends, especially from A. O. Prickard, Esq.,
Fellow and Tutor of New College, who has been always
ready with suggestive criticiffln, and to whom Ι was indebted

to the kind courtesy of the Provost and Fellows of Queen’s
College, the collation of the valuable Queen's College MS.
which appears in an Appendix to this volume.
