NOTES. EPODE II. 461

founded on Prop. 4. 4. 4 ‘Multaque nativis obstrepit arbor aquis‚‘ an
ingenious conj. ‘ frondes ' for ‘ fontes‚’ ‘lymphis ’ being then the dative.

28. quod, sc. ‘murmur quod.‘

29—36. We pass to winter amusements.

29. tonantis, an epithet of the god which has become almost a part
ofhis name3 but it serves to recall his influence on the weather and
responsibility for storms, although thunder is rather an accessory of
summer storms.

annus hibernus, the wintry part of the year, as ‘frigidus annus,'
Virg. Aen. 6. 311. ‘Jove’s winter' is the winter which in its season
Jove brings round again, C. S. 32 ‘ Iovis aurae)

32· obstantes, ‘ set to stop them.’

33. levi, prob. ‘ smooth‚’ though as ‘ ames ’ does not occur elsewhere
in poetry, it is not possible to pronounce certainly on the quantity of its
first syllable.

rara, ‘open‚' ‘wide-meshed‚' see Con. on Virg. Aen. 4. 131. The
epithets, though, as has been remarked, more abundant than Horace's
maturer taste would have admitted, serve, by recalling the circum-
stances, to recall the pleasures of the sport.

35. laqueo, a dissleabIe, not an anapaest, cp. Epod. 5. 79, 11. 23,
and see Index of Metres. η

37 foll. The ‘malae amoris curae,' its follies and fancies and jealousies‚
are left for the idle and luxurious life of the city. The ‘pudica uxor’
and the pleasures of home are more likely to be found in the country.
Virg. G. 2. 523 ⁶ dulces pendent circum oscula nati 3 Casta pudicitiam
servat domus.' For the attraction which makes ‘curas’ agree with
the relative, and leaves ‘malarum' without a subst„ cp. Sat. 1. 4. 2
⁶ alii quorum comedia prisca virorum est‚’ Virg. Aen. 1. 573 ‘urbem
quam statuo vestra est.’

39. quodsi. The apodosis begins at v. 49 ‘non me.’ If I can have
all these home pleasures Ι do not care for the less luxurious diet.
Haupt's alteration, ⁶ quid si,' impairs the antithesis between the ‘ pudiea
uxor‚’ etc.⁹ and vv. 37, 38.

in partem, ἐν μέρει, ‘ sor her share.’

iuvet, with a zeugma. It is the appropriate verb only with ⁵ domum‚'
‘ graces,' ‘helps.’ By uniting closely the two substantives, ⁴ the home
with its blooming childrem’ we can bring ‘ dulces liberos ’ into some re-
cognisable relation to it, but still the new substantive breathes into the
verb a new idea of ‘helping to govern‚' which does not belong to it
properly, and which was not needed so long as it was only construeted
with ‘ domum.’

41. Sabina, Od. 3. 6. 37 foll. Virg. G. 2. 532.
