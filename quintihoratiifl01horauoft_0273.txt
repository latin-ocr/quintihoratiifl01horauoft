8. Mercurius, as the god of speech and wit. Compare Homer's
description os Aphrodite's cestus, Il. 14. 216 ἔνι μὲν φιλότης, ἐν δ’ ἵμερος
ἐν δ’ ὀαριστὺς 1 πάρφασις ἥ τ’ ἔκλεψε νόον πύκα περ φρονεόντων. Orelli
quotes Plutarch, Conjugalia Praecepta Praef. οἱ παλαιοὶ τῇ Ἀφροδίτῃ
τὸν Ἑρμῆν συγκαθίδρυσαν, ὡς τῆς περὶ τὸν ’γάμον ἡδονῆς μάλιστα λόγου
δεομένης, τήν τε Πειθὼ καὶ τὰς Χάριτας, There is nothing in the Ode
and little in Horace's usual style to support Keller's recent suggestion
that Mercurius here is the god of gain, a sting in the tail of the Ode.

ODE XXXI.

This Ode professes to be written (3.0. 28) on the day on which
Augustus dedicated the temple of Apollo on the Palatine, to which was
attached the famous Library, see Epp. 1. 3. 17, 2. 1. 217, 2. 2. 93, Suet.
Aug. 29, Dio C. 53. 1. Propertius gives an account of the inauguration
of the temple, at which he had himself been present, 3. 23 ⁴ Quaeris cur
veniam tibi tardior? Aurea Phaebo Porticus a magno Caesare aperta
suit,’ etc.

‘ What special boon shall his poet ask of Apollo to-day‘? Not wealth
in com-lands or cattle, not gold and ivory, not vineyards in Campania.
He envies neither those who grow the rich wines nor the trader who at
the eost of so much risk buys and drinks them. Content with humble
fare, all he asks is the power to enjoy health‚ a sound mind now, and an
old age not wanting either in honour or in the pleasure of poetry.'

Line Ι. dedicatum. The Latins said ‘dedicare deum’ as well as
‘dedicare aedem,’ perhaps from the image of the god which was in-
stalled in his shrine. Liv. 5. 51 ‘Iunonem dedicare.’

2. vates. The poet has a special claim on Apollo, the inspirer of
his art.

novum, see on Od. 1. 19. 15 3 or it may be a hypallage, the ‘ novelty ’

referring to the pouring, not to the wine, the meaning being, ‘ pouring
sor the first time!

4. Sardiniae. Val. Max. 7. 6. 1 calls Sardinia and Sicily ‘benig- ‘

nissimas urbis nostrae nutrices.'

segetes, com-land; as osten Epp. 2. 2. 161 ‘ Qui segetes occat tibi
mox frumenta daturas.’ He is speaking of ‘latifundia’ in the corn-
growing provineeS, see on Od. 1. 1. 9.
