aptius, Pacem et duello miscuit‚’ i.e. ‘ has shrunk from the sword, which
to a braye man is the security of life, as though it were only an imple-
ment of death.' ‘Aptius ’ is found in several MSS„ and some of value,
but there is no trace of the other alterations, ⁶ hine: ‘ et,’ which it seems
to necessitate. ‘Inscius' is found in the great majority of MSS„ and
was read by all the Scholiasts‚ one of whom interprets ‘ qui nesciret
vitam viro forti potius de armis sperandum.’ Bentley objects to the
vulg„ that the last charge ‘timuitque mortem' involves ‘minorem
culpam quam ea quae praecesserant.' But it is quite in the old Roman
spirit to sum up the* baseness of the captives in the charge that they
‘seared death.' Compare the title ὁ τρέσας, affixed to the Spartan who
escaped at Thermopylae, Hdt. 7. 231, and Tyrtaeus 8. 12 (Bergk), τρεσ-
σάντων δ’ ἀνδρῶν πᾶς ἀπόλωλ’ ἀρετή.

37. hic, ‘ captum militem quasi reum ad iudices ductum aggreditur,’

sumeret. The subjunctive has to do double duty; for that mood
would be required if it were merely the indirect question, ‘ignorant
whence he drew ’ ; but it has a further potential soree, ‘ ignorant whence
he might draw,' ⁴ would draw if he tried?

38. pacem duello miscuit, ‘has forgotten the difference between
peace and war’ 3 in the latter safety is to be won only by the sword.

40. altior ruinis, ‘lifted higher (in appearance—relative height,)
by the sall of Italy? This is simpler than ‘towering over,’ as Orelli
takes it.

41. fertur. Cp. 3. 20. 12: it is the common formula when the
narrator would throw the responsibility of his narrative on hearsay or
tradition. Possibly here it is intended to call a momentary attention to
the contrast between the spirit of Regulus and the spirit of modern
Rome: ‘ Strange as it sounds‚ they tell us.’

42. ut eapitis minor, a poetical form of ‘capite deminutus'3 the
genitive after the analogy of “integer vitae,’ ‘captus animi,’ ete. ‘ Capite
deminutus est qui in hostium potestatem venit‚‘ Fest. It is in Horace's
manner, by a slight alteration of the common formula, at once to recall
and to avoid a technicality which, if literally reproduced, would be
harsh or pedantic. See on 2. 4. 24, 4. 2. 42, 4. 14. Ι, and compare
notes on 5. 27. 38, 4. 15. 9. He refused, according to Cicero, ‘senten-
tiam dicere,’ ‘to speak in his place‚' ‘quamdiu iureiurando hostium
teneretur non esse se senatorem.’

44. Ar. Ran. 804 ἔβλεψεν οὖν ταυρηδὸν ε’·γκύψας κάτω.

45. donee . . firmaret. ‘So long as he was striving to brace up
the resolve os the fathers and to hasten his departure! A contrast is
intended between his stern sadness, so long as it was still doubtful
‘whether the senate would listen to his corrnsel, and the light heart
