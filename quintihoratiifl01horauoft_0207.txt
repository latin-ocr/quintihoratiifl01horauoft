would be now, if we take Frankc's date for the Ode, thirty-four years
old.

45-50. Cp. Virg G. 1. 503 ‘Iampridem nobis caeli te regia, Caesar,
Invidet, atque hominum queritur curare triu1nphos; Quippe ubi sas
versum atque nefas,’ etc.

47. nostris vitiis iniquum, ‘ intolerant os,' ‘ non diutius aequa mente
vitia ferentem.' Franke sees in these words a reference to the censorian
power which Octavianus had accepted in the year B.C. 29.

48. aura tollat, keeps up the character of the winged Mercury, ever
‘ on tiptoe' for ssight.

49. triumphos. ¹ Caesar triplici invectus Romana triumpho Moenia,’
Virg. Aen. 8. 714; ⁴ Curules triumphos tres egit, Dalmaticum, Actia-
cum, Alexandrinum: continuo triduo omnes,' Suet. Oct. 22.

50. pater. The title of· Pater patriae’ was not solemnly given to
Augustus by the Senate till 13.c. 2, but, as Ovid says, Fast. 2. 127, it
was only the ratification of a title which had been long given him by
popular usage: ‘Sancte Pater patriae, tibi Plebs, tibi Curia nomen Hoc
(ledit; hoc dedimus nos tibi nomen Eques; Res tamen ante dedit? It
was a title familiar to Roman ears, having been given by the senate
to Cicero (JuV. 8. 243), and in earlier times to Camillus by the army
(Liv. 5. 49); and ‘ I'arenti patriae’ had been the inscription placed by
the people on the column erected in the Forum to Julius Caesar’s
memory, Suet. Jul. 85, Cic. Phil. 1. 2. Horace promises (Od. 3. 24.
27) a similar title to any one who will venture to restrain the licence
of the time, pointing, of course, to Augustus, ‘ Si quaeret Pater urbium
Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat Refrenare licentiam.' The title of
‘ Princeps ' (Od. 4. 14. 6), sc. ‘ senatus,’ must also (if we take Franke's
date for the Ode) be here anticipated‚ as it was conferred on him in the
following year (ac. 28) by Agrippa, his colleague in the Censorship,
Dio C. 5 3. 1.

51. Augustus is to restore the disturbed order of things, vv. 21, 22,
to stay the civil war, and to retrieve the military glory of Rome, which
had been tarnished by the defeat of Crassus in ΒΕ. 53, and Antony in
Bc. 36.

equitare, Od. 2. 9. 24.

52- Caesar. The true name of the incarnate Mercury is reserved to
be the last word lest on our earS, the word that stills all the fears and
satisfies all the doubts of the preceding stanzas.
