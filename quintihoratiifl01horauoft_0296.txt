and 2. 7. 16 ‘ fretis aestuosis‚’ and see on 1. 6. 2 and 3. 5. 5. The rela-
tion is of the nature os those classed together as the ‘ablative absolute';
i.e. the adjective is predicative, and it is not the substantive alone, but
the substantive and adjective together which constitute the circumstance
which justifies or limits the main statement. Pollio's occupation is a
‘lofty calling‚' because the ‘ buskin ' which he wears is that of the Attio
stage.

14. consulenti, absol. ‘in its counsels.' Like ‘ maestis‚’ it describes
the time at which Pollio's services would be most needed.

Pollio. There seems to be force in the reservation of Pollio's
name sor this place, when our interest has been roused sor the forth-
coming history, ⁶ the history written‚' Horace would say, ‘ not by a by-
stander, but by the great orator, statesman, warrior.’ Compare a more
evident instance of art in the collocation osa name, in the conclusion of
Od. 1. 2.

euriae, ‘the senate? Cp. Od. 3. 5. 7.

16. Delmatico, Virg. E. 8. 6 foll. Pollio was sent by Antony against
the Parthini, an Illyrian tribe who had espoused the cause of Brutus and
Cassius. He defeated them, and took their chief town, Salonae. For
the ablative see above on v. 12.

19. fugaces, pred. ‘ scares them till they would fain fly.'

20. equitum voltus; compare with Dillr. Plutarch Caes. 45 (in the
account of the battle of Pharsalia) οὐ ’γὰρ ἠνείχοντο τῶν ὑσσῶν ἀναφερο-
μένων οὐδ’ ἐτόλμων ἐν ὀφθάλμοις τὸν σίδηρον ὁρῶντες, ἀλλ’ ἀπεστρέφοντο
καὶ συνεκαλύπτοντο φειδόμενοι τῶν προσώπων. Ritter sees a definite
reference to Caesar’s order to his soldiers (Plut. ib.) to ² strike at the
saces’ of the Pompeians.

21. audire. . duces, ‘to hear you reading of chiefs: etc. Ritter,
Orelli, and Dills. take it of hearing the voices of the chiefs haranguing
or giving command in the battle. Both interpretations are as old as
Acron. The latter would suit better with the preceding stanza; but
there would be a harsh zeugma in the use of ‘audire‚’ which, with
‘ cuncta terrarum sul)acta.' must mean ‘ to hear of’ ; and although ‘ non
indecoro pulvere sordidos ’ may refer only to the dust and heat of battle
(Od. 1. 6. 14 ‘pulvere Troico Nigrum Merionen'), not to biting the
ground in death, yet if ‘audire' means ‘to hear them speaking,’ we
should certainly have expected an epithet for ⁵duces‚' which should
appeal to the ear rather than to the eye. Bentley felt this difficulty,
and wished to read, in despite of the MSS„ ‘ videre.’ The point, which
Orelli desiderates in our interpretation of the verse, is possibly given
by the fact (recorded by the elder Seneca, Controv. 4 Praef.), that
‘recitation' by an author of his compositions was a novel practice
introduced by Pollio himself.
