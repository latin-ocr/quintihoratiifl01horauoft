NOTES. BOOKIV, ODE II. 40³7

Ov. Trist. 4. 2. 51 ‘ Tempora Phoebea lauro cingentur, quue, Miles, Io,
magna voce, Triumphe, canent.’ That i't was held to involve a personi-
fication of Triumphus appears from Livy's expression, 45. 38 ‘ [Milites]
triumphurn nomine cient, suasque et imperatoris laudem canentes per
urbem incedunt) But compare especially Hor. Epod. t). 21 foll. ‘Io
Triumphe, tu moraris aureos Currus et intactas boves? Io Triumphe,
nec Iugurthino parem Bello reportasti ducem‚’ etc.; see note there.
Orelli's ‘ procedit ' rather improves the stanza, by giving it a more con-
tinuous connection with the last. ‘It is Caesar's triumph that will
unlock my voice, as it will os that of all Rome'; and there is more ob-
vious motive in the ‘te‚’ helped by the corruption to ‘tu‚' for altering the
third person to the second, than vice versa. Bentley, dissatisfied (and
it must be admitted, after all, with some reason) with both these inter-
pretations, cuts the knot by reading ‘Isque dum procedit‚' of Caesar.

51. civitas omnis seems to add the climax to vv. 33—44 of Antonius'
share in the rejoicings, and vv. 45—48 of Horace's own, and to prepare
the way for the division again of their duties in the sacrifices. ‘We will
shout together in the shouting town, but when we come to offer our
thank-offeringS‚ we shall be as unequal as we were in our poetical offer-
ing, ten bulls and cows for you, and a little calf for me.’

dabimus thura, of altars by the wayside, on which incense was
offered as the procession passed.

5 3. te decem tauri3 cp. 2. 17. 30 ‘ reddere victimas Aedemque
votivam memento: Nos humilem feriemus agnam,’ and 3. 23.

54. solvet, sc. a voto.

55. iuvenescit, is growing to a ‘iuvencus ’ ; the common use of the
verb is ‘to grow young‚' when one has been old.

56. in mea vota, ‘to pay my vow.’

57. ‘W’hose horns are like the moon three days old.’ The homely
ending of the Ode has been severely criticised : ‘ Desinit in vitulum . .
formosa supeme.’ It is at least intentional on Horace's part3 see Introd.
to Odes i-iii‚ ᾗ 11. 3, and on 3. 5. 55. On the immediate topic of the
last six lines see on 3. 13. 4. In this place the detailed account of the
intended offering increases the contrast of vv. 5 3, 54, and balances to
some extent the inequality. ‘ You will sacrifice animals brought by the
score from your “latifundia,'' 1 the calf which Ι bred myself, whose
birthday and marks I know by heart.’ 1t is like his offer to Maecenas
in 1. 20. 1—4 q. v. ‘common wine; but home-made, earefully stored, and
with pleasant memories about it.’

59. Perhaps from the horse in Hom. Il. 23. 454 Ὃς τὸ μὲν ἄλλο τόσον
