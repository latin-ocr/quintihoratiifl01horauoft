NOTES. BOOK ΠΙ, ODE XXJJ, XXIII. 373

19. post τος 1. 18. 5 ‘post vina?

iratos apices=‘iratorum‘; see on r. 15. 19. But there is an equal
hypallage in making ‘ apices ’ the object of ‘trementi.’ The ⁴ apex ’ (see
on 1. 34. 14) represents the state and power os an eastern king.

21. laeta, ἑκοῦσαι-πρόθυμος, and so, ‘ with goodwill.‘

22. nodum, se. of clasped hands, or of the concord which they
express. ‘ Gratia iuncta sororibus,’ 3. 19. 16. Seneca, interpreting the
charaeteristics with which they appear in paffltings, describes the Graees,
Benef. 1. 3 ‘manibus implexis.'

23. vivae=‘vigiles‚‘ 3. 8. 14.

producent ‘te,’ an extension of the ordinary ‘producere eoenam,⁷
‘ comissationem.’

24. dum . . fugat, ⁵ whilst he is putting to rout‚' as though he were
all night striving to do so, and only victorious in the morning. Cp.
the tense in Virg. E. 9. 23 ‘Tityre dum redeo, brevis est via, pasce
capellas.'

ODE XXII.

An inscription (or a poetica] dedication which would have served
sor an inscription) for a pine-tree which overhangs the Sabine farm, and
which the poet dedicates to Diana, to be honoured by him henceforth
with the yearly sacrifice of a young boar.

Line 1. montium eustos; 1. 21. 5 foll. With the enumeration of
Diana's attributes cp. Catull. 34. 9 soll. ⁴ Montium domina . . Silvarumque
virentium . . Tu Lucina dolentibus Iuno dicta puerperis!

3. ter. The number three has constantly mystic and ritual associa-
tions; see, inter al„ Od. 1. 28. 36, Epp. 1. 1. 37. Here it ean hardly
be entirely unconnected with the triple character of the goddeSS, ‘tri-
formis'; Virg. Aen. 4. 54 ‘Tergeminamque Hecaten, tria virginis ora
Dianae.’ She was Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, Hecate in Hades.

6. per exactos annm, as each year comes round.

7. meditantis3 see on 3. 13. 4. The participle seems to imply that
his tusl-:s are just growing to the fit size,—he is thinking of using them,
but has not yet done so‚—and so points his age.

8. donem, subjunctive of purpose; ‘ quarn donem ’ gives the full

meaning of ‘tua esto.’

ODE XXIII.

‘Pray duly at the new moons, O country housewife. and offer to the
Lares frankincense and corn and a porker, and your wines and your crops
