262 ΗΘΚΛ ΤΠ CARMJNA.

2. 13. 26 (of Alcaeus‘ style) ‘ aureo plectro'; Ov. Met. 10. 150 ‘cecini
plectro graviore gigantas, Nunc opus est leviore lyra.‘ The ‘ plectrum'
was a little bar, usually of gold or ivory, with which the player touched
the strings of the lyre.

ODE ΙΙ.

‘Wealth has no value save to use well: used as Proculeius used it,
it wins immortal farne. To tame the spirit of avarice is more than to
own the world. Avarice is like the thirst of dropsy, which grows by
indulgence. Virtue calls him alone happy, him alone the true king,
who has subdued the love of money.‘

That the Ode is addressed to Salustius is enough to show that there
could be no danger of the world's applying its doctrine to him.

The little we know of him is chiefly derived from Tacitus, Ann. 3. 30,
where his death in AJ). 20 is recorded: ⁴ Crispum, equestri loco, C. Salus-
tius rerum Romanarum florentissimus auctor, sororis nepotem, in nomen
adscivit. Atque ille quanquam prompto ad capessendos honores aditu,
Maecenatem aemulatus, sine dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium
consulariumque potentia anteiit, diversus a veterum instituto per cultum
et munditias copiaque et affluentia luxu propior. Suberat tamen vigor
animi negotiis par, eo acrior quo somnum et inertiam magis ostentabat.
lgitur incolumi Maecenate proximus, mox praecipuus cui secreta impe-
ratorum inniterentur, et interficiendi Postumi Agrippae conscius, aetate
provecta speciem magis in amicitia principis quam vim tenuit.’ Horace
had satirised him some years before (Sat. 1. 2. 48 foll), but he has now
made his acquaintance in the Court, circle. Pliny (N. H. 34. 2) men-
tions that the Sallust family possessed copper mines in the Tarentaise
(‘Centronum tractu’), and it has been suggested that this gave a special
point to the first stanza, ‘ As you know from your experience of ore.'

Lines 1—4. ⁵ As silvei· has no brightness while it is still in the mine, so
wealth only acquires its value by the uses it is put to.’ In the first line
and a half we have the allegory‚ its application helped by the epithet
⁴ avaris,' which suggests the miser's hoards as the parallel sor the use-
less ore; in the remainder of the stanza we have the application,. buti
still clothed, with the exception of ⁵ temperato,' in terms metaphorical,
taken from the allegory (⁵ lamnae,' ⁴ splendeat'). See notes on Ι. 35. 19,
4. 2. 5-8, 4. 4. 59. .

2. abdito terris,‘as Od. 3. 3. 49 ⁴ aurum irrepertum . . cum terra*
celat.‘ Much of the force of the stanza is lost if we take it with the
Scholiast of the miser's treasure, ‘ qui defosso incubat aur0‚’ Sat. 1.7

1. 41.
