Ι 86 HORA TII CARMJNUM

with a genitive of the person patronized is unlikely, and the combination
‘duce . . auspice' is harsh. Bentley reads ex conj. ‘Phoebo‚’ which
would satisfy Aeron’s note, though not so probably as ‘Teucri.’ The
slight variation of a technical phrase, which is the main ground on which
Bentley opposed the vulg„ is really quite in Horace's manner, see on Od.
3. 5. 42.

28. certus, σαφής, ἀψευδής.

29. ambiguam, ‘that in a new land there should be a Salamis to
dispute the name,’ cp. the use of ἀμφίλεκτος, Aesch. Ag. 1585. Lucan,
3. 183, in memory of this place, ‘veram Salamina.' Cp. Virgil’s ‘ falsi
Simoentis,’ ‘ simulata Pergama,’ Aen. 3. 302, 349.

30. peioraque passi, Virg. Aen. Ι. 199 ‘ O passi graviora dabit Deus
his quoque finem'; both are from Hom. Od. 12. 208 ὦ φίλοι οὐ γάρ
πάι τι κακῶν ἀδαήμονές εἶμεν.

32. iterabimus, ‘take again to the boundless sea,’ which he had just
crossed from Troy. It gives much more force to the dreariness of ‘ingens ’
than to suppose that they had landed for the night in their ssight, see
on v. ἰ 3.

ODE VIII.

‘Ly-(lia, thy love is ruining young Sybaris. He is no more to be seen
on horseback, in the Tiber, at wrestling matches, quoits, javelin-throwing.
He is lost to manly life like Achilles in his woman's dress.'

The name of ‘ SybariS‚’ at least, is chosen to suit the ideal character.

Line 2. properes, so the majority of MSS. as against ‘ properas ’; and
the subj. seems necessary to suit ¹ oderit,’ which can hardly be a future,
standing alone among so many presents. ‘Equitat,’ ‘temperat,' are
more lively than the continued subj„ and the mood of ‘ properes' and
‘ oderit ' will account for copyists giving ‘ equitet,' ‘ temperet.’ Bentley
remarks that they would have completed their work. and written ‘ timeat,’
‘ vitet,‘ ‘gestet,’ if they had not been stopped by the metre at ‘ timet.’

4. patiens, in age and strength capable of bearing, as Juv. 7. 33
‘ aetas Et pelagi patiens et cassidis atque ligonis.'

5. militaris, as a soldier, in soldierly exercises. For these, cp. Od.
3. 7. 25-28, 3. 12. 1²9, S. 2. 2. 9 soll„ Epp. 1. 18. 52, A. P. 379.

6. Gallica ora= ‘ora equorum Gallicorum': the best Roman horses
came from Gaul, Tae. Ann. 2. 5 ⁶ fessas Gallias ministrandis equis.’

lupatis, sc⁴ ‘frenis,¹ bits roughened with jagged points like wolves'
teeth‚ used for taming the fiercer horseS. ‘Asper equus duris contun-
ditur ora lupatis,' Ov. Am. 1. 3. 15; Virg. G. 3. 208 ‘duris parere
lupatis.’
