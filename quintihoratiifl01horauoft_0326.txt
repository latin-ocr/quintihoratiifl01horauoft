290 JJORA TII CARMINA.

27. dura navis, 1. 32. 7 ‘ Sive iactatam religarat udo Litore navim?

28. fugae, φυγῆς, ‘ exile‚' Aristotle Pol. 3. 9.

29. sacro silentio, i.e. of the silence with which divine rites are re-
ceived. Cp. 3. 1. 2 ‘Favete linguis: carmina . . Musarum sacerdos . .
canto?

30. magis, placed first as the antithesis to ‘utrumque,' and to be
taken with the whole ‘densum . . vulgus': they crowd more thickly,
and drink every word more greedily, where Alcaeus is singing.

31. tyrannos. Myrsilus, etc.

32. densum humeris, ‘pressing shoulder to shoulder? ‘Haeret
pede pes densusque viro virs Virg. Aen. 10. 361.

bibit aurez‘ avide audit,’ Aer. The sounds are poured, not as
into a cup which receives passively, but as into the drinker's mouth.

33. illis carminibus, ablative with ‘stupens,’ as Sat. 1. 4. 28, 2. 2. 5.
Sappho’s singing is included as well as Aleaeus'. Compare with these
stanzas Od. 3. 11. 13—24, Virg. G. 4. 481<484

34. demittit aures, contrast Epod.‘ 6. 7 ‘aure sublata,⁷ of a hound
on the scent.

centiceps, possibly to be explained by 3. 11. 16 ⁴ Cerberus, quamvis
furiale centum Muniant angues caput eius,' since the expression ‘ore
trilingui’ (cp. 2. 19. 31) in the same place seems to imply that there
the picture is of three heads. Sophocles calls Cerberus Αἴδου τρίκρανον
σκῦλακα, Trach. 1098, Hesiod Ἀίδεω κύνα χαλκεόφωνον πεντηκοντακά-
ρηνον, Theog. 312: Pindar‚ acc. to Interpr. Ven. on Hom. Il. 8. 368,
ἑκατοντακάρηνον. These epithets may imply in the Greek poets real
variety of imagination3 but in a Roman poet they are echoes‚ and there
is nothing therefore to prevent Horace giving Cerberus his Sophoclean
form in one Ode and his Pindaric complement of heads in another, as
Virgil speaks at one time with the Greek tragedians of ‘ agmina Eume—
nidum‚’ at another with the Alexandrines of Megaera, Allecto, and
Tisiphone. For a still more pertinent instance see Conington on Virg.
Aen. 6. 287 as compared with 10. 565, and 6. 605 compared with
12. 845.

35. Aesch. Cho. 1048 πεπλεκτανημέναι πυκνοῖς δράκουσιν, Virg. G. 4.
482 ⁴ implexae crinibus angues Eumenides?

36. recreantur, ‘take rest.’

37. Prometheus. This form of the legend, which makes Prome-
theus still undergo punishment in Tartarus (cp. Od. 2. 18. 35, Epod.
17. 67), is known to no other extant author.

Pelopis parens. Tantalus, joined with Prometheus in the two
passages referred to. For the legend of him see Hom. Od. 11. 582.

58. laborem, so Keller edits, following the Paris and Berne MSS„
for the Vulg. ‘laborum' In either case it is an attempt to put the
