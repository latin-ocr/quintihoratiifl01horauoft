ODE XXV.

The ‘ vices superbae ’ which await a sading beauty when lovers begin
to leave her sor her younger rivals.

Line 1. iunctas, the ‘ fenestrae bifores' (Ov. ex Pont. 3. 3. 3), shut
close sor the night.

2. iactibus, so the oldest MSS„ against ‘ ictibus' the reading of the
mass of more recent ones.

3. amat, ‘cleaves t0'3 cp. its metaph. use, Virg. Aen. 5. 163 ‘litus
ama,’ ‘ hug the shore.'

5. multum facilis, cp. S. 1. 5. 57 ‘multum demissus'3 2. 3. 147, 2.
5. 92, Ep. 1.10.3, 2. 2. 62.

10. levis=‘ contempta?

11. sub interlunia, changes os the moon are, in common fancy,
still associated with changes of weather: αἱ σύνοδοι τῶν μηνῶν χειμε-
ρινὼτεραι, Theophr. de Ventis. 3; ‘ Interluniorum dies tempestatibus
plen03‚’ Veget. de Re Mil. 5. 10.

18. pulla, ‘ subnigra’3 it is used of the eolour of a ripe fig, Epod.
16. 46; for the contrasted ‘ virente '—‘ pulla,' see on Od. 1. 21. 7.

19. aridas frondes. The same image is used in Od. 4. 13. 9 ¹ Im-
portunus enim [cupido] transvolat aridas Quercus.' The commentators
multiply illustrations of the metaphor of the ‘ sere and yellow leaf‚’ as
Aesch. Ag. 79 τὸ . . ὑπεργὴρων φυλλάδος ἤδη κατακαρφομένης; Archil.
Fr. 91 οὐκέθ’ ὁμῶς θάλλεις ἁπαλὸν χρόα, κάρφεται ’γὰρ ἤδη.

20. dedicet Hebro. In plain words, ‘throw away‚’ as in the next
Ode, ‘Tradam protervis in mare Creticum Portare ventis’; but the
river seems to be chosen as one specially associated by Roman poets
with images of winter (Epp. 1. 3. 3, 1. 16. 13, Virg. E. 10. 65, Aen.
12. 331), and so one to which the offering of withered leaves is more
appropriate. A large number of Editors‚ following a conjecture ot
Rutgers‚ have adopted ‘ Euro’ as simpler, and a better parallel to
⁴ animae veris comites,’ Od. 4. 12. 1; ‘ Notus eomes Orionis‚’ 1. 28. 2²3
but such an alteration in all the MSS. is very unlikely‚ and when
coupled with the similar case in Virg. Aen. 1. 317, next to impossible.
