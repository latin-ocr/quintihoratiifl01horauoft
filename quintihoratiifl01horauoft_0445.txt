NOTES. BOOKIV, ODE IV. 409

6. res bellica, opposed to ‘ res ludicra,' ‘ war and all that belongs to
it'; its enterprises and victories.

Deliis, ie. ‘Apollineis'

8. Cp. 2. 1 2. 11 ⁶ ductaque per vias Regum colla minacium?

9. Capitolio, dative case. The notion is of his being the central
figure in the processiou seen slowly ascending the Capitol, seen by the
crowd on the Capitol, or perhaps rather by Jupiter Capitolinus himself.

10. praefluunt=‘ praeterfluunt '2 4. 14. 26 ‘Aufidus Qui regna
Dauni praefluit Apuli) Liv. 1. 45 ‘ infima valle praefluit Tiberis.’
⁴ Horace evidently means that the scenery of Tibur contribules to the
formation of lyric genius. It is XVordsworth's doctrine in the germ;
though, if the author had been asked what it involved, perhaps he would
not have gone further than Ritter, who resolves it all into the con-
duciveness of a pleasant retreat to successful composition,' Conington.
Cp. Epp. 2. 2. 77 ‘ Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et sugit urbem,’
where nothing but the prosaic explanation is attempted—the bustle and
the business ofa great town interfere with the poet's proper work.

12. Aeoli0; 2. 13. 24, 3. 3ο. 13, 4. 9. 12.

13. principis urbium ; 4. 14. 44 *dominae Romae.’

14. suboles, the sons of Rome. The idea added by this form is ap-
parently the promise of the future: the young, the growing progeny.

15. vatum, like the ‘ lyrici vates ⁹ of 1. 1. 35, the roll of poets, which
as yet contained few, is any, but the Greeks.

17. testudinis aureae; Pind. Pyth. 1. 1 χρυσέα φόρμιγξ ’Λπόλλωνος
καὶ ἰοπλοκάμων σύνδικον Μοισᾶν κτέανον. As with ‘aureo plectro,' 2.
13. 26, it is a way of expressing the perfection of the music.

18. temperas, ‘rulest'3 1. 24. 14 ‘ auditam moderere arboribus
fidem?

19. mutis quoque piscibus, and so even to him, unlikely as it might
have seemed. Compare the way in which in the preceding Ode he
professed to seel that, unfit as he was to sing of such themes, yet the
happiness of Caesar's return might possibly find him a voice.

22. monstror digit0; cp. Pers. 1. 28 ‘At pulchrum est digito mon-
strari et dicier hic est.'

23. Romanae lyrae3 see on 1. 1. 34, 1. 32. 3, 3 Greek instrument
played by a Roman. Cp. Epp. 1. 19. 32 ‘Latinus fidicen.’

24. spiro, of the ‘breath ² ofpoetry; see on 2. 16. 38.

ODE IV.

‘ Like a young eagle that leaves the nest, tries his wings, then swoops
down, first on sheep-folds, but soon on more dangerous foes;-like a
young lion to the eyes of the unsuspecting hind, who is to be the first
