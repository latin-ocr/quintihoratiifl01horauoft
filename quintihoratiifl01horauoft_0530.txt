494 HORA ΤΠ EPODON LIBER.

58. pontifex. A ‘pontifex' had the right and duty of being present
at all sacred rites, and of seeing that they were duly performed. Horace
has acknowledged in Sat. 1. 8 his cognisance of Canidia’s doings on
the Esquiline. She turns the rables on him. He was there as a very
master in the art, and yet has held her up to public scorn. Orelli quotes
the title which Cicero gives Clodius on account of his unlawsul presence
at the rites of ssona Dea, pro Sest. 1 7 ‘stuprorum sacerdotem?

60-62. ‘what profit, then, were it to me [i.e. if you could do this
with impunity] to have made the fortune of Pelignian hags [i. e. to have
paid for learning every secret of magic], and to have mixed the speediest
poison? But [though Ι do not mean to let you off, and though I call
my poison speedy] the fate that awaits you is all too slow for your
desire.’ The text is that os the Berne MS„ and is defended by Bentley,
Orelli, Ritter, and Dillr„ and it gives the best connection of thought.
There is, however, good Ms. authority sor ‘proderit' 111 v. 60, and for
‘si' against ‘sed’ in v. 62. The question must then be removed to the
end osv. 62, and the sentence will refer to Horace, not to Canidia,
⁵ What will it profit you richly to have paid Pelignian hags (i. e. to find
spells that might free you from me), or to have mixed the quickest
poison (i. e. in order to kill yourself)‚ if a sate awaits you too slow for
your desires.’

61. v'elocius, sc. ‘ solito-³

62. tardiora answers verbally to ‘velocius’

63. in hoe, ‘ for this purpose.'

65. infidi, in his treatment os Myrtilus. Tantalus' character is to be

67. obligatus, ·' bound 111 the way of,’ ‘ bound so as to be exposed to.'

aliti, the vulture that eat his lix-er.

71. N0r1003 Od. 1. 16. 9.
74. ‘ I 11111 ride on my enemy's neck, and the world shall bow to my

insolent triumph,' i. e. my triumph over you will make me as proud and
as insolent as if the world were at my feet, as though Ι were ‘terrarum
domina'; Od. Ι. 1. 6.

76. movere cereas imagines, ‘to make waxen images feel’; Sat.
1. S. 30 ‘ Lanea et effigies erat, altera cereag maior Lanea, quae poenis
compesceret inferiorem. Cerea suppliciter stabat, servilibus ut quae
Iam peritura modis.⁷ The waxen image represented the person who
was the object of the enehantments. and was supposed to communicate
to him its paius3 Theoc. 2. 28 (Ως τοῦτον τὸν Kapan ἐγὼ σὺν δαίμονι
τάκευ, ⁶05 τάκοιθ’ ὑπ’ ἔρωτος ὁ Μύνδιος αὐτίκα Δέλφις, Virg. E. 8. 80.

77. curiosus, ‘through your prying.’

80. desideri, as Epod. 5. 38 ‘amoris poculum‚’ ‘ a potion to excite
desire?
