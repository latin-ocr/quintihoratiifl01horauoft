obvious blot, and the insertion of ‘ n' would easily suggest itself, we
lack any authority for the use of ⁶ nominatis ' in any appropriate 561156.
Of prosessed conjectures, Bentley's ‘ inominatis ' is the most plausible.
In that case ‘male' must mean ‘with evil effect,’ like ‘fraude mala,'

14. eximet, ‘ banish.'

15. mori metuam, not in the sense of 3. 9. 11, but in the less usual
sense of ‘nc moriar metuam.' with the sentiment cp. 4. 15. 17 foll.

3. 8. 12. Juvenal’s ‘ Calcatamque tenet bellis Socialibus uvam,' 5. 31, is
most likely a reference to this passage rather than a real date of wine
which was drinkable in his time. Ritter points out that the reference to
the succession of civil wars has probably a secondary purpose as height-
ening the feeling of the last stanza, the peace and security conferred on
the world by Caesar’s rule.

Philippi. The date is probably not quite without a meaning. The
times have quieted down, and Horace has tamed down also since then.

ODE XV.

⁷ The subject is the same as that of 1. 25 and 4. 13, the odiousness and
ridiculousness of the desires and ways of youth kept on when youth
itself has departed. The spirit 15 rather that of the Epodes (⁴ Archilo-

chio felle,’ Mitseh.) than of the Odes; possibly a real person may be
pointed at. Meineke suggested that the name ‘Nothus,' a name un-

known to extant Greek literature, was the poetical representative of the
common Latin ‘ Spurius‚’ see Introd. to 2. 4.
