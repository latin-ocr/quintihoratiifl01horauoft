GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE EPODES. 139

ἰαμβίζειν, and see Arist. Poet. c. 4, 5, cp. Hor. A. P. 79 ‘Archi-
lochum proprio rabies armavit iambo').

All the indications of date to be discovered in the poems
themselves fix them to the first period of his life as an author.
Their references to current politics, both positively‚ as in the
allusions to the war with Sextus Pompeius, and negatively, in
the vagueness with which they deal with the general situation
at horne (see on Epod. 7 and 16), belong to the decade be-
tween the battles of Philippi and Actium. We notice in their
style indications which point the same way—occasional harsh-
nesses of construction, a redundancy of epithets‚ a tendency
even in the best poems to poetica] commonplace, we may add
a grossness of subject and language, which his mature taste
would have pruned away. The Epodes stand with the Satires
at the opening of Horace’s literary life——not unconnected with
thern in tone, nor in their literary antecedents, nor in their
treatment in his hands. The Roman Satirist‚ he tells us,
looked, for all but the poetical form of his composition, to
Greek Comedy. In the Epode he has returned to the per-
sonal lampoon, the earliest use of poetry for purposes of attack
and caricature, and that of which Comedy, according to Aristotle
(Poet. l. c.), was the development. It is in the taste which
leads him for models to Lucilius and Archilochus, rather than
in any bitterness of special poems, that we may trace probably
his own description already referred to (Epp. 2. 2. 513 see
Introd. to Books i—iii,§ 1) of the personal motives that first
drove him to write poetry. In any case it is characteristic of
the man that his Satires should mellow and humanize into the
Epistles, and that the Epodes should drop so early their ἰαμβική
ἰδέα, and soften and generalize into the Odes. The process in
both cases is nearly complete before the name of the compo-
sition is changed.

Horace himself speaks (Epod. 14) of the Book as preparing
for publication, and as having occupied some space of time
in composition. The date of its publication is generally held
to be fixed by the relation between Epod. 9 and Od. 1. 37 to
the year B.C. 31-30.
