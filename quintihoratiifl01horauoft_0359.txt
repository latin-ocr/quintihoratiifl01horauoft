grandem of the destiny which she is willing to allow them if this one

proviso is attended to.
40. Priami . . busto. The Commentators remind us that according

’ to virgil, Aen. 2. 567, Priam did not actually receive sepulture.

41. insultet, ἐπισκιρτᾶ, ἐπιθρώσκει. Although the word is used in its
proper sense, there is still a feeling of its tropical sense ; to ‘leap upon '
a grave being a mode of ‘insulting' the memory of its tenant, Hom. Il.
4. 177 τύμβῳ ἐπιθρώσκων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. Compare with Juno's
words the actual description of the Troad in Lucan 9. 966 soll.

4²- Capitolium, the pledge and emblem of Rome's etemity‚ ι. 37. 6,
3. 5.12‚ 3. 30. 8.

43. fulgens, with ‘ stet! It seems to be opposed to the waste grass-
grown ruins of Troy. Cp. Virg. 8. 348 ‘Capitolia . . Aurea nunc olim
silvestribus horrida dumis.'

triumphatis, Virg. G. 3. 33 ‘triumphatas gentes,’ Aen. 6. 837.

possit, ‘be mighty to) Orelli quotes Tibull. 1. 7. 3 ‘Aquitanas
qui posset sundere gentes? It exalts the greatness os the seat.

44. ferox, as it were, ‘at the sword’s point’; but the two epithets
‘triumphatis‚’ ‘ferox‚' are antithetical‚ contrasting the attitude of the
two peoples. Cp. ‘Latium ferox,' Ι. 35. 10.

Medis, the peoples of the East, 2. 1. 31, but with special thought of
the Parthians: see on 1. 2. 22.

45. late, with ‘horrenda,' as ‘late tyrannus,’ 3. 17. 9, ‘populum late
regem‚’ Virg. Aen. 1. 21.

46. medius liquor, ‘the intervening water‚' ‘ venit medio vi pontus,’
Virg. Aen. 3. 417 ; the Straits of Gibraltar are meant. They stand for
the VVest as the Nile for the East.

49-52. ‘Only the gold unfound, and so the better placed, let her
fortitude be shown in spurning rather than in gathering with a hand
that snatehes for mortal uses all that is sacred.'

50 fortior = ‘dum fortior sit? It is a question whether this con-
dition grammatically qualifies the ‘extendat ' of the preceding stzmza,
or the ‘tanget ' of the following one. It is better, perhaps, to take it
with the former, as the latter matches more closely with the condition
laid down in v. 57 foll. ‘Let her name be known in all shores from
East to VVest, only as the despiser of gold, not as the greedy searcher for

to Troy.’ This stanza seems to confirm the view that Horace, under
the talk of Troy, is thinking of real moral dangers of his country.

51. humanos in usus must be taken with ‘rapiente,’ as* it is anti-
