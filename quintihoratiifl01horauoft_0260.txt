224 HORATII CARMINA.

ODE XXVI.

‘ The Muse's friend, I can cast sorrow and fears to the winds. The
politics of Parthia that trouble all the world are nothing to me. Help
me. sweet Muse, to weave a chaplet of freshest lyric verse for my dear
friend Lamia.'

It is difficult to see the point of connection between the first and last
parts of the Ode, unless, indeed, as has been suggested, Horace is
holding up his own cheerfulness and its source to Lamia's imitation,
see Introd. to Od. 3. 17. If Epp. 1. 14. 6 refer to the same person as
the two Odes, the trait there given, ‘rapto de fratre dolentis Insola-
biliter‚' may confirm the idea that he was a person on whom sorrow sat
heavily.

Aelius Lamia, the school friend of Numida (Οά. 1. 36. 7) and the
*vetusto nobilis ab Lamo' of 3. 17. 1, is generally identified with
L. Aelius Lamia who was Praefectus urbi in A.D. 32, and died Λα). 33.
Tac. Ann. 6. 27 ‘genus illi decorum, vivida senectus? If this Ode
therefore is to be dated before B.C. 23, he must have been quite a young
man when it was written. Rider, feeling this to be a difficulty, suggests
that the Lamia of the Odes is an elder brother of Lucius. The name
of a Q. Aelius Lamia, ‘triumvir monetalis,' has been found on a coin
of this date. He thinks that it is his death that Lucius is represented
as lamenting in Epp. 1. 14. 6.

With w. 1—6 cp. Virg. G⁴ 2. 490—497. The friendship of the Muses
gives to Horace the freedom which virgil attributes to philosophy and

a country life.

Line 1. Musis amicus, gives the reason for his being able to throw
care to the winds; for the expression, cp. ‘amicum Crethea Musis,’
Virg. Aen. 9. 774.

metus. Cp. Virg. G. 2. 491 ‘ Atque metus omnes et inexorabile
fatum Subiecit pedibus.’

Creticum, see on Od. 1. 1. 14. It is a proverbially stormy sea.

quis, best taken, perhaps, with the SchoL, as a dative plur.; cp.
Epod. 11. 9 ‘ in quis ' 3 ‘by whom the king of the frozen coast beneath
Arctos is dreaded.’ ‘Quid Tiridaten terreat' is the same question put
another way: but it is more general, and Tiridates would sear other
