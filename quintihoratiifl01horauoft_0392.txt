that as late as the 12th century there was a church standing on a site
which can be identified about six miles south of Venusia, which is
named in ecclesiastica] documents of the time as ‘Ecc1.SS. MM. Gervasi
et Protasi in Bandusino Fonte apud Venusiam? If this evidence be ἢ
held conclusive we must either suppose that Horace writes from an ¹
affectionate memory of the Bandusian spring, such as he elsewhere ἶ

shows of Mount Vultur, the nestling village of Acherontia, and other ἕ

spots near the home of his boyhood; or, if ‘ cras donaberis’ seems too ἶ
definite for a mere address of fancy, we must conclude that at some l
period in his life he revisited Venusia. The fact, however, that he does ¹
not himself indicate the locality of the ‘Fons Bandusiae’ may have
caused topographers to make various guesses in early times as well as

late, and the Venusian claimant of the name need not be the genuine J

one. Verses 2-8 are probably interpreted of the Fontanafia, a festival
on Oct. 12, named by Varro, Ling. Lat. 5, ⁵ in fontes coronas iaciunt et
puteos coronant?

Metre—Fifllc Asclepiad.

Line 1. vitro, Virg. Aen. 7. 759 ⁴ vitrea Fucinus unda.⁵

2. mero, floribus, haedo. These seem to be three distinct offerings.
For the flowers see the account of the Fontanalia quoted above. For
the wine and the sacrifice cp. Ov. Fast. 3. 300 foll. ‘ Huc venit et fonti
rex Numa mactat ovem, Plenaque odorati disponit pocula Bacchi.’

4. cui frons, etc„ cp. 3. 22. 7 soll , 4. 2. 55 foll. Here the immediate
purpose is to describe the age of the kid. Granted that a deity (and the ,
spring is divinized) desired a sacrifice, he would be pleased by the
details of the promised ceremony as well as by its ritual exactneSS.
Perhaps we may add that as the victim was after all for the eating, not
of gods, but of men, the religious ceremony being not much more than
a ⁶ grace before meat,' the offeret would take an interest in the delicacy
of the offering, and would moralize with more complacency on the irony
of its fate.

5. destinat, ‘ promiseS‚' ⁴ points to?

6. frustra: nam, cp. 3. 7. 21.

gelidos, rubro, a double antithesis is intended, Horace, aster his
manner (see on 2. 3. 9, 3. 4. 46, 4. 4. 10), indicating the contrast in each
case by putting an epithet to only one of the two substantives, ‘the
cold [clear] stream,⁷ ‘the [warm] red blood.’

9. hora, ‘ season,’ as A. P. 302 ‘sub verni temporis horam.’

Caniculae, the name given by the Romans to Sirius, the brightest Ι
star in the constellation of the ‘ Great Dog.’ On the history of the term
‘ dies Caniculares‚' our ‘ dog day& see Smith's Diet. Ant. s. v. ‘ Astro-

nomia.'
