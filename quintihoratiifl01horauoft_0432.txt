396 HORA HJv CARMJNA.

place of emphasis, may have this force here, ‘ F ear thern not, for they
are quarrelling among themselves.’ Bentley himself wishes to substitute
‘dissors,' to which he gives the rather far<fetched sense of ‘neque ad
Europam nec ad Asiam pertinenS, inter utramque medius, et quasi extra
sortem positus.’

29. prudens; 1. 3. 22.

32. trepidam 2. 11. 4.

33. componere aequus=‘ aequo animo ordinare! The editors quote
from Suidas the words of Cratinus : ἄνδρας σοφοὺς ἑχρῆνκτὸ παρὸν πρᾶγμα
εἷς δύναμιν θέσθαι καλῶς. ‘ Componere‚’ however, has more distinctly the
idea of ⁴ reducing to order' ias in ‘componere lites‚' and in less matters
·' componere togam ³) 3 it has reference to the coming metaphorS. ⁶ The
present, if you yourself are equable‚ may be kept in some order: the
future is like a rushing river,—it may be calm in its strength: it may
be flooded and carrying everything before it! The vagueness of‘ quod
adest’ and ‘ceteras' suggests that they include neamess and farness of
place as well as time, and so form something of a link between VV. 25—
28 and what follows. ‘Y0u, Maecenas, are scheming about the dis-
tant and the future; but the present in all senses is all that we can
control.‘

34. alveo. Some good MSS. have ‘ aequore‚' which Orelli adopts as
the less common word, and the less likely therefore to have been substi-
tuted by a copyist. He refers to Virg. Aen. 8. 86 and 96, where
· aequor' and ‘placidum aequor ' are used of the surface of the Tiber.
But there they (listinctly mean the ‘level surface⁷; here this meaning
is barred by the epithet ‘medio'

35. cum paee 3 Madv. ᾗ 257, obs. 2.

36. adesos, worn or broken by the stream ; οὕς τε κυλίνδων χειμάρρους
ποταμὸς μεγάλαις περιέξεσε δίναις. Mitsch. compares ⁴ levia saxa‚’
1. 17. 12.

39. elamore, as Virg. Aen. 3. 566 ‘Ter scopuli clamorem inter cava
saxa dedere‚' and Hom. Il. 17. 165 ἠϊόνες βοόωσιν.

40. diluvies ; 4. 14. 28. A poetieal word for the usual ‘diluvium.'

41. amnes, the rivers generally, or possibly the lesser streams that
seed the river of which we are speaking.

potens suj, ἐγκρατὴς ἑαυτοῦ, αὐτάρκης,

42. in diem, as Bentley pointed out, with ‘ dixisse,' not with ‘ vixi.’

43. dixisse, a simple perfect; see on 3. 4. 51. Itis the net result
when each day is summed up

vixi; Virg. Aen. 4. 653„ Seneca (Ben. 5. 17) seems to put the two
passages together, ⁵Quis extremo die dicere audet : Vixi et quem dederat
cursum fortuna peregi'? The idea is that to have lived in the full
sense, to have felt the pleasure of lise, for one day, makes a man in-
