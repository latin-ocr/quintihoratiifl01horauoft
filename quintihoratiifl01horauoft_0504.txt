signia' which in v. 12 are snatched from him.

11. ut constitit, when, notwithstanding this appeal, he was stripped
and set in ‘the midst to await their further pleasure.

15. viperis, ί furiali habitu,' Schol. Canidia and her sellow witches
are called Furies in Sat. 1. 8. 45.

17. caprificos, a common growth of cemeteries; Juv. 10. 145.

19, 20. The construction is ‘uncta ranae sanguine ova strigis plu-
mamque.’ Compare a charin for a similar purpose in Prop. 3. 6. 27
‘Illuc turgentis ranae portenta rubetae Et lecta exsuccis anguibus ossa
trahunt, Et strigis inventae per busta iacentia plmnae.' ‘ Strix' is the
screech-owl; the ‘rana turpis ' is 1116 ‘ rubeta,' a toad, so called because
found in bramble-thickets; it was believed to be poisonouS. Plin. N.H.
32. 5, Juv. 1. 69.

Hiberia, strictly the country lying between the Caucasus on the
north, Armenia on the south, Colchis, which separated it from the
Euxine, on the west, and Albania, which separated it srom the

the ingredients of a philtre, ‘a sknll torn from between the teeth osa
wild beust) In any case they are appropriate to this ‘desideri pocu-

in this respect the more potent spell of W. 37—40.

24. Colchicis = ‘1nagicis‚' such as Medea might have kintlled.

26. Avernales, as the witeh in Virg. Aen. 4. 512 ⁶ Sparserat et latices

28. currens. The epithet seemed out of place to Bentley, as the
boar's bristles do not rise 111016 when he is running, and he advocates
Heinsius' conjecture · Laurens? But ‘ currens' is in point as completing

29. abacta nulla conscientia, ‘not one whit deterred by her con-
sciousness of what she was doing,' i.e. of its cruelty and wickedness.
For the use os ‘nulla ’ see on Od. 5. 20. 7.
