NOTES. BOOK III, ODE XXVI. 385

17. humili modo, ταπεινῶς. ‘Modus' does not seem to have been
actually used in a musical or poetieal sense in the singular.

18. mortale, ‘os mere man's utterance‚' Conington.

20. tempora, the god's own temples, as appears from 4. 8. 33
‘ ornatus viridi tempora pampino Liber.'

ODE XXVI.

The poet professes himself soiled in his addresses to Chloe, and
recognises the meaning of the failure ς ‘ He has made his conquests 'in
his time; but his campaigns are over. Here in Venus’ temple he will
hang up the instruments of gallantry for which he has no more use.
May Venus (we expect, ‘grant him peace at last‚’ ‘spare him further
love troubles ’) make Chloe feel one little smart of her lash.’

1 Th(e1 conclusion points the irony of the beginning. Compare 4. 1.

On the position of the Ode see Introd. to Books i—iii, ξ ΙΙ. 1.

Line 1. vixi, implying that that life is over (cp. 3. 29. 43 Vixi.
cras vel altra‚‘ etc. ), although‘ nuper idoneus,’ which qualifies it, implies
that it is only just over

idoneus; 4.1.1 2.
3. The arms of the warfare which he abandons (cp. 4. 1. 16 ‘ militiae

tuae') are to be suspended in the temple of Venus, as the ‘gladiator
emeritus,’ Epp. 1, 1. 4, affixes his ‘Herculis ad postem.’

4. barbiton. The·lute implies that his love-songs are over as well
as his loves.

5. The wall of the temple of Venus Anadyomene which her statu'e
has on its left hand. Ritter thinks that the particular description shews
that Horace is referring to a special temple, at Velia or elsewhere,
familiar to himself. Most editors say that the left wall is chosen
because the left was (according to Cic. de Div. 2. 39) the side of good
omen to the Romans, though the poets, copying the Greeks, often
reverse its character.

6. ponite, addressed to the attendant& the‘ pueri ’who are named
in the similar 1 19.14.

7. funalia; Virg. Aen. 1. 727. They were apparently tapers of a
large size, ropes smeared with wax, here used to light the lover to his
mistress’ door. Cp. Prop. 1. 3. 10, 4. 16. 16, and Theoc. 2. 128 Εἰ δ’
ἄλλᾳ μ’ ὠθεῖτε καῖ ἁ θύμα εἴχετο μόχλῳ Πάντως καὶ πελέκεις καὶ λαμπάδες
ἧνθον ἐφ’ ὑμέας.

et arcus. ‘Quibusianitores terrerent' is the gloss in the valuable
MS. in Queen's College (Oxford) Library. Cp. 3. 14. 23. It is an odd
