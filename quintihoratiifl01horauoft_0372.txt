Marsus et. Apu1us. The Marsi (cp. 2. 20. 18 ‘qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis’) are distinguished by other writers, as Virg. G. 2. 167
⁶ genus acre virum Marsos.y The Apulian is named as a fellow country-
man of the poet; see on 1. 22. 13.

10. ancffiorum, as if the genitive of ‘ancilium ’3 so ⁶ vectigaliorum,’
Suet. Aug. c. 101. For a collection of similar cases see Macrob. Saturn,
1. 4. The ‘ancile’ was one of the pledges of the eternity of Rome.
For the legend of its descent from heaven, and for the meaning of the
plural ‘ ancilia: see Ov. Fast. 3. 345—384.

counselled the senate not to ransom himself and his fellow captives?
The danger which he foresaw was, that if there were the hope of
ransom, Roman soldiers would come to prefer captivity to a brave
death. Mna they had come to acquiesce in it, so much as even to
sorget their own country.

15, trahentis =‘derivantis.⁷ ‘Tracing the stream of ruin that would
flow to future ages from the precedent, if,’ etc. No exact parallel sor
the phrase ‘perniciem trahere’ in the sense of ‘to trace the stream of
ruin‘ has been alleged; though the metaphor of the stream is common
enough, as 3. 6. 19 ‘ Hoc sonte derivata clades In patriam populumque
fluxit'; but as we say of one who points out a ‘derivation' that he
⁴ derives,' so in Latin the idea of actually drawing a stream passes
easily into that of irnsing it. Cp. 3. 17. 5 ‘nepotum Per memores
genus omne fastos Auctore ab illo ducis originem.’ And Virg. G. 3.
121 ‘Et patriam Epirum referat, fortesque Mycenas, Neptunique ipsa
deducat origine gentem.' All the MSS. have ‘trahentis’ Canter’s
conjecture, ‘trahenti,' seems to have been the reading of the Schol.

suin? Bentley would read ‘exempli trahentis‚’ construed after the
analogy of ‘mali exempli,' etc.

17. periret. The lengthening of the short syllable is possibly
justified by the caesura, see on 2. 20. 13. It is not parallel to ‘caeca
timet aliunde: 2. 13. 16, and other'cases in which the metrieal aceent
falls on the lengthened syllable. Horace does not seem to have allowed
a second trochee in the Alcaic, as Alcaeus himself did. No alteration
is likely: ‘perirent’ is doubtful in point of number, and ‘perires’
(Lachmann) is too rhetorical.
