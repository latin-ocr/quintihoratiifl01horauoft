NOTES. BOOKIII, ODE XXIV. 381

invidi goes with both clauses3 it is the clue to the apparent incon-
sistency.

33. querimoniae, lamentations in the senate, in society, in literature,
over the evils of the time.
35. leges sine moribuS, cp. 4. 5. 22, where Augustus is represented

as having touched both springs of reformation: ‘ Mos et lex maculosum
edomuit nefas.'

37, 38. pars, latus; cp. 3. 3. 55 ‘ Qua parte debacchentur ignes’;
1. 22. 19 ‘ Quod latus mundi nebulae malusque Iuppiter urget.'

37. inclusa, ‘ fenced in,⁷ as is the heats were intended to bar it from
human intrusion. ‘ Terra domibus negata‚' ibid. Virg. Aen. 7. 227 ‘ si
quem . . . dirimit plaga solis iniqui.’

39. solo, ablative of place.

40 foll. The whole passage is an echo of parts of Od. 1. 3. Cp. v.
43 with ‘ audax omnia perpeti‚' ete. The ‘ mercator ' is always Horace's
type of the eager pursuit of wealth. Od. 1. 31. 10 foll„ Epp. 1. 1. 45
foll. To cross the sea is to fly in the face of the ‘ prudens Deus,' who
put that barrier between land and land.

eallidi; ep. Soph. Ant. 335 foll„ summing up the triumph of man’s
wit: τοῦτο καὶ πολιοῦ πέραν πόντου χειμερίῳ νότῳ χωρεῖ. . περιφραδὴς
ἀνήρ. The apodosis to the whole sentence is the original ‘Quid leges
proficiunt Ῥ ‘ Horrida . . navitae ’ and ‘ magnum . . arduae ' are both
constructed after ‘si.' The asyndeton serves to point out that the last
two clauses are not fresh instances of that general thirst for wealth which
belies sumptumylaws, but two explanations of the merchant's boldness:
if the sea is rough the seaman is cunning (for the relation of the two
adjectives see on 1. 3. 10) to overcome its difficulties, and in any case
there is the prevailing motive behind, the dread of the one great shame,
poverty.

42. magnum opprobrium 3 Sat. 2. 3. 92 ‘Credidit ingens Pauperiem
vitium.’

44. arduae, pred. That the hill is steep is the reason why men turn
out of the path.

45-50. Orelli well compares with this burst Epod. 16. 17 ‘Nulla sit
hac potior sententia,' etc. The emphasis of position and repetition is
shared between vel and πως ‘ vel‚' ⁸ vel ’ emphasising the indifference of
the smaller consideration, ‘anywhere that you please‚—give it to the
gods or throw it into the sea ;’ and so the importance of the greater one,
‘ only get quit of it once for all ’ : ‘nOS,’ ‘nos ' singling out the poet and ,
the audience whom he addresses from the rest of the world; ‘let us at
least‚' the ‘ melior pars ² of Epod. 16.
