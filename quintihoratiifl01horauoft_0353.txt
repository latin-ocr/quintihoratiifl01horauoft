NOTES. BOOKIII, ODE ll. 317

accordance with the shisting wind of popular favour? In the same
strain Horace tells Lollius that his soul is ⁶ Consul non unius anni Sed
quoties bonus atque fidus Iudex honesto praetulit utili,⁷ 4. 9. 39. He
has clothed in Roman language the Stoie paradox that the wise man is
always a king, cp. Epp. 1. 1. 107, Sat. 1. 3. 156, and see on Od. 2. 2. 9.
Compare the exposition of it in Cicero, Acad. Quaest. 4. 44, and the
anecdote which he tells, ‘ Albinum qui tum praetor esset, cum Carneades
et Stoicus Diogenes ad Senatum in Capitolio starent, iocantem Carneadi
dixisse : Ego tibi praetor esse non videor quia sapiens non sum . . tum
ille, IIuie Stoico non vi‹leris.’

17. repulsae, the technical word for losing an election.

18. intaminatis, a few MSS. read ‘ incontaminatis,‘ which Bentley is
inclined to support. ‘ Intaminatus’ is an ἅπαξ >xe-y„ but formed naturally
from the obsolete ‘tamino’ (Fest. S. v.)‚ found in ‘contamino,⁷ ‘at-
taminost

fulget, cp. 3. 16. 31 ‘Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae!

20. popularis aurae, a common mctaphor; ‘ventus popularis,' Cic.
Clu. 47, ‘aura favoris popularis,’ Liv. 22. 26. In Virgil’s ‘gaudens
popularibus auris‚' Aen. 6. 817, the idea is of a favouring wind, here it
is of the changeableness of the wind. Compare the uses of πνεῦμα ancl
πνοή. ¹

21. Compare the epigram of Simonides on those that fell wilh Leoni-
das (ξ 98. ed. Bergk) Οὐδὲ τεθνᾶσι θανόντες, ἐπεί σφ’ ἀρετὴ καθύπερθε
Κυδαῖνουσ’ ἀνάγει δώματος ἐξ Ἀΐδεω, Virg. Aen. 9. 641 ‘ Macte nova
virtute, puer3 sie itur ad astra} 6. 130 ‘ardens evexit ad aethera virtus ‘
(with Conington's note). It is here at least only an immortality of farne
that is promised. Cp. 3. 30. 6 ⁶ Non omnis moriar‚’ 4. 8. 28 ⁶ Dignum
laude virum Musa vetat mori: Caelo Musa beat‚' with the verses before
and after.

22. negata, ‘pennis non homini datis‚' 1. 3. 35. There is no way,
but Virtue makes one. Ovid, probably imitating this, Met. 14. 113
‘ Invia virtuti nulla est via!

tentat iter, probably from Virg. G. 3. 8 ‘Tentanda via est qua me
quoque possim Tollere humo‚’ as that is from Ennius.

23. udam opp. to ‘liquidum aethera,’ 2. 20. 2, etc.

25. The sels-restraint that can keep a secret is praised as one of the
old Roman virtues, Compare 1. 18. 16 ‘arcani Fides prodiga‚’ Sat. 1.
4. 84 ‘ commissa tacere Qui nequit, hic niger ests ete. and Volteius over
Philippus' wine, ‘dicenda tacenda locutus,’ Epp. 1. 7. 72. The wording
is apparently from the verse of Simonides (ξ 60) ἔστι καὶ σιγᾶς ἀκίνδυνον
γέρας, which Plutarch <Apophth. Reg. et Imp.5 Aug. 7) mentions Augustus
as quoting. The mysteries of Ceres are used merely as an illustration.
