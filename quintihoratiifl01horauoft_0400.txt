364 HORATII CARMJNA.

ODE XVII.

Compare Introduction to 1. 26. The purpose of this Ode ean only
be guessed. The introductory passage seems very much as if it was
playful. 1t traces Aelius Lamia's pedigree to Lamus, the Homeric
king of the Laestrygones (Od. 10. 81 Ἑβδομάτῃ δ’ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου αἰπὺ
πτολίεθρον Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην. Cp. Cic. ad Att. 2. 13 ‘si vero in
hanc τηλέπυλον veneris Λαιστρυγονίην, Formias dieo, qui fremitus homi-
num! ')‚ whose locality was fixed by the Romans in the neighbourhood
of Formiae. Possibly‚ although he throws it on the public voice
(‘ ferunt,’ v. 2), Horace may be inventing a mythical ancestry for Lamia,
as virgil does for the Iulii, Sergii, Cluentii, etc„ as Cicero does playfully
for himself (Tusc. 1. 16 ‘regnante meo gentili,’ sc. Serv. Tullio), and
as was done on a large scale in Varro's lost work, De Familiis Troianis.
The Lamiae, though not famous in the ages of the Republic, seem to
have been a prominent family under the Empire. Juv. Sat. 4. 154 ‘ Hoc
nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti‚' in allusion to L. Aelius Lamia Aemili-
anus, put to death by Domitian. Cp. ib. 6. 385.

Horace writes the day before a holiday, possibly to Lamia at some
country house which belonged to him near Formiae. This would give
an additional point to the mention of the sea-shore and to the gene-
alogical introduction‚ as if the poet had meant to say, ‘You are a great
rnan at Formiae at least, in the home of your heroic ancestor? He
professes to foresee a rainy day, and bids Lamia use the dry weather
to house his wood and prepare for to—morrow’s festival. The connection
of thought we may compare with 1. 9. That Ode will show that it is
not necessary, from the mention of the sea, to suppose that Lamia was
at Formiae. In both probably the stormy weather, if not actually
assegorical, is used to enforce a moral beyond that which appears on
the surface. The one other certain reference to Lamia in Horace's
poems (Od. 1. 26), and another probable one (Ep. 1. 14. 6), suggest to
us that he was a man before whom his friend would desire to set the
sunny side of life. .

Vv. 2-—5 have been condemned by many eritics with no support from
external evidence; but the Introduction which their omission would
leave would not be more free from difficulties than the unmutilated one.
Peerlkamp more consistently condemns the Ode.

Line 2. ‘Since the world has it that it was from him that the Lamiae
of old days took their name, as well as the whole race of their children's
children whose memmy lives in Fasti, he doubtless is the founder to
