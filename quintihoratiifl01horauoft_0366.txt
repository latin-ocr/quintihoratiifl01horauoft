330 HORA ΤΠ CARMJNA.

soldiers‚ not the towns, that Horace is thinking of. ‘Addidit' views
the action from the side of the towns.

41. consilium, a trisyllable‚ the penult. being lengthened before 1,
and the semiconsonantal i=y. So in 3. 6.6 ‘Hinc omne principium.’
Cp. Virgil's use of ‘ tenuia‚’ G. Ι. 397; ⁴ fluviorum‚' ib. 482, etc.

dato gaudetis almae. They not only give gentle counsels, but
when they have given them they rejoice to further them3 for in respect
to them, as in all other respects, they are ⁵ almae! This epithet stands
last, as summing up the beneficent character of the Muses, which has
been the theme of the first half of the Ode, and as leading us by the
association of contrast to the impersonations of brute and insensate
force, whose vain efforts and doom are the subject of the latter half.

42. seimus ut, ‘we all know how.‘ The preceding stanzas have
been professedly addressed to the Muses. ‘Scimus’ reminds us that it
is really a homily addressed to Horace’s contemporaries, who had wit—
nessed, so he hints, a repetition of the Gigantomachia. The same com—
parison is hinted in Od. 2. 12. 6- 10.

43 immanemque, the‘ que 'adding only another designation of the
same object.

If vce must go by a mere majority of older MSS. we must read
‘ turbam’ here, and ‘turmas ³ in v. 47.

44. caduco, καταιβάτης κεραυνός, Α65611. P. V. 358. Here, as in 2.
13. 1 Ι, the adjective has something of that sense of ⁴ proneness to fan:
which Bentley (ad loe.) rightly holds to be proper to it. The bolt hung
ready to sall: a touch launched it. The adjective heightens our feeling
of the ease with which the Titans were swept away. Bentley condemns
it here, as merely equivalent to ‘ cadente‚' and would therefore alter it
to ‘corusco,' which would hardly be an epithet of sufficient point to
occupy the emphatic place.

45—48. The universality of Jove's rule is indicated not only by the
nouns ‘ terram‚' ⁶ mare,’ etc. which describe his triple empire in earth,
in Hades, in heaven, but also by the triple contrast os the epithets ex-
pressed or implied: the ‘dull earth' (‘bruta‚' 1. 34. 9) and the ‘sea
stirred by every wind‚' ⁶ the [busy] eities of the living and the sad realm
of the shades,⁷ ‘the [‘ quieti ordines' of the] gods and the turmoil of
niortal men.¹ However much they differ in all else, they are all alike
subject to his sway. For Horace‘s manner of marking a contrast by
giving an epithet to one only of the two things contrasted see on 2. 3. 9,
3. 13. 7, 4. 4. 10. Note also that the epithets actually given are all
such as imply some difficulty or unlikelihood in the way os his rule. He
can sway the earth‚ however insensate it be; the sea, however stormy;
the sad shadow-world‚ as well as the world of men; the turmoil of
earth, as well as the quiet gods.
