xviii INTRODUCTION.

(D) of about the same age, which was in the library of
Strasburg, and perished in the siege of 1870. Keller
has given, at the end of vol. i, a list of its most im-
portant readings in the Odes 1, 2 and 3. 1, 2.

o·. (Orelli⁷s S) St. Gall.

To these Keller and Holder add a Paris MS. (7975) of the
11th century, to which they both attribute high value (γ).

Of the Ioth century also is the MS. in Queen's College,
Oxford, a collation of which was given at the end of this volume
in the first and second editions (Reg.).

It has been already suggested, that the only method by which
conclusive evidence upon questions of disputed reading could
be gathered from MSS. of such late date would be by grouping
them in families or ‘recensions,' each family being made by its
common readings to bear witness to some archetype of much

greater antiquity than the copies which we now possess. This ’

has been attempted by Keller, and with more completeness
by Holder¹. Α and (1, λ and l, φ and ψ, 35 we have seen,
have been supposed to be severally related in this way, and
the readings of their imagined archetypes are indicated by
Holder by the signs A', λ’, F. With his fuller ‘apparatus
criticus⁷ on the Satires and Epistles, the process is carried
still further, and the result is, to the extent that uniform read· ,
ings can be obtained, a certain number of conjecturally restored
MSS. of the 7th and 8th centuries. These and the other soli-
tary representatives of older MSS. are again grouped into
three classes.

The first of these is distinguished as containing, with many
faults of carelessness, and with a certain number of grammatical
corrections (e. g. ‘ videri,' against the metre in Epod. 16. 14),
little or no proof of alteration on rhetorical or general grounds.
In this class Holder places, of the MSS. named above, A, α (in

is responsible for the Odes and Epodes. in the Rhein. Mus. vol. xix,
p. 211—2273 as regards Holder, who undertakes the Satires and EpistleS,
in the Presace to vol. ii.
