lamnae, the unwrought bar into which the ore was first run. Bent-
ley pointed out that the construction is ‘inimice lamnae nisi splendeat,'
not as it had been strangely taken, ‘ nullus argento color est nisi splen-
deatss For the syncopated form see on Od. 1. 36. 8.

3. Crispe Salusti. For this inversion of the family and the gentile
name cp. ‘Hirpine Quinti,’ Od. 2. 11. 2; ⁶ Fuscus Aristius,’ Sat. 1. 10.
61; ‘ Cascellius Aulus,' A. P. 371. Such violations of the old usage
were growing common. Thus Velleius Paterculus (born B.C. 19) has
‘Drusus Claudius’ and ‘Silvanus Plautius' (2. 97 and 112, quoted in
Dict. Ant.).

4. usu seems to apply primarily to the brightening of genuine metat
by handling (λάμπει ’γὰρ ἐν χρείαισιν ὥσπερ ἐκπρεπὴς χάλκος, Soph. Fr.
742, quoted by Ritter); secondarily and metaphorically, to the right
use of money. In the epithet ‘ temperato‚' on the contrary, the moral
sense is the predominant one.

5-8. An instance of the wisely directed use oswhich he speaks.
Acron's note is, ⁴ Proculeius qui pius sie erga fratres suos Scipionem et
Murenam fuit ut cum spoliatis bello civili patrimonium suum de integro
divideret‚’ in which ‘ Scipionem' has been ingeniously altered by Estre
to ·’ Caepionem‚’ the name of the person who suffered with Murena for
a conspiracy against Augustus in ae. 22. There is no reason, however,
from any other authority, to suppose that the two were brothers. It
rnay perhaps be doubted whether Horace's words necessarily imply
that Proculeius had more than one brother: the plural generalises.
That he was the brother (or cousin, for this doubt always besets the
words ‘frater' and ἀδελφός) of Murena (Od. 3. 19. 11, Sat. 1. 5. 38),
the ‘ Licinius’ of Od. 2. 10, and the brother of Maecenas⁷ wife Te—
rentia, we know from Dio 54. 3. Proculeius was high in Augustus'
favour; so much so, that he is named as one of the persons to whom
at different times the emperor had thought of marrying his daughter
Julia (Tac. Ann. 4. 40). Juvenal (7. 94) couples him with Maecenas
as a patron of literature.

5. vivet extento aevo, ‘ shall live beyond the term of life) Cp.
Virg. Aen. 10. 468 ‘breve et irreparabile tempus Omnibus est vitae;
sed famam extendere factis Hoc virtutis opus?

6. notus animi, cp. probably the same construction Od. 4. 13. 21
‘nota artium.’ Horace uses the Greek gen. of relation to avoid the
awkwardness of a preposition‚ ‘ notus propter' or ‘ob.’ With ‘in
fratres paterni ’ cp. Od. 4. 4. 27 ‘paternus In pueros animus Nerones.’

7. aget, ‘ will carry on his way‚' will not allow him to fall, as he
⁶ volitat vivus per ora virum.' The weight of MS. testimony and Acr.‚
though not Porph„ are in favour of the future as against ⁴ agit‚' and it
is preferable also as suiting better with ‘ vivet,’ and as not implying,
