508 INDEX OF METRES.

7. Two couplets called Pytlzimnbic, stom the name Πύθιος,
given to the Hexameter as the metre of the Delphic oracles.

(1) The Dactylic Hexameter, followed by an Iambic
Dimeter‚ Epod. 14, 15.

(2) The Dactylic Hexameter, followed by an Iambic
Trimeter, Epod. 16.

The Iambic verse in this metre consists entirely of pure
Iambics.

8. A couplet known as the Creater Sapphic, from the likeness
of the rhythm of both verses to the Common Sapphic verse-
The first line (which goes by the name of Aristophanes) is
a Sapphic without the initial trochees. The second is a Sap-

phic, with a choriambus inserted before the dactyl :—

-υυ-υ-Ὰ,

-υ---υυ--υυ-υ-Ξ,

It occurs in Od. Ι. 8.
9. Hz'ppomzcteum, Od. 2. 18.
A couplet consisting of a Trochaic Dimeter Catalectic‚ fol-
lowed by an Iambic Trimeter Catalectic :—
-ψ - υ - υ Ξ,

Ξ-υ-Ξ-υ-υ--Ἁ

10. Ionicus a minore, Od. 3. 12.

This is composed entirely of the foot called ‘Ionicus a
minore’ :—

k) Q ·-· -u

The metre is described by Hephaestion, who takes as his
type an Ode of Alcaeus, of which the first line, which he quoteS,
seems as if it may have been the original of Horace's Ode (see
Introd. to Od. 3. 12). It is not, he sayS, as it may easily be
taken to be, an unbroken succession of similar feet, but broken
into periods of ten feet each. Bentley pointed out that Horace’s
Ode consists of forty feet, i.e. four such periods, and held that
the arrangement in lines, which many editors debate, was
merely a necessity of the writer or printer, and not to be
elevated into a law of the metre.
