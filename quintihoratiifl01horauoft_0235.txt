NOTES. BOOK J, ODE XIV. 199

6. sine funibus. They are the ὑποζώματα of Plat. Rcsp. p. 616 C:
cp. Acts 27. 17 βοηθείαις ἐχρῶντο ὑποζώννυντες τὸ πλοῖον, ropes passed
round the hull to prevent the titnbcrs starting.

7. durare, Virg. Aen. 8. 577 ⁴ durare laborem?

carinae, apparently a plural for a sing„ the keel and all that belongs
to it, the timbers that start from it, the hull‚ the bottom. Bentley takes·
it as a proper plural, ‘Other ships about you cannot hold without
anchors.’

8. imperiosius, ‘too tyrannous,' ‘peremptory.’ The sea insists on
breaking in, will have no refusal.

10. non di, sc, ‘ sunt integri.' The images osgods which were carried
on board as a protection to the ship; Pers. 6. 30 ‘Iacet ipse in litore, et
una Ingentes de puppe dei?

11. Pontica, cp. Catullus, ‘ Dedicatio Phaseli,' 4. 13 ⁶ Amastri Pon-
tica, et Cytore buxifer‚' etc.

12. nobilis, with ‘silvae‚' ‘ a forest of name‚' cp. 3. 13. 13 ‘ fies
nobilium tu quoque fontium!

14. pictis puppibus, Virg. Aen. 5. 663. Ships in Homer are μιλ-
τοπάρῃοι. Seneca, perhaps thinking of this place, Ep. 76 ‘navis bona
dicitur non quae pretiosis coloribus picta est, . . sed stabilis et firma et
iuncturis aquam excludentibus spissa.’

timidus, ‘in the time of his sear.’

15, 16. nisi debes . . eave, ‘unless thou art doomed to make sport
for the winds, take good heed‚' i. e. if it is any use to warn you, be
wamed. ‘ Cave,’ absolutely, as in Epod. 6. 11 ‘ cave . . cave.’ ⁶ De-
bere ' is ‘ to be bound to give ⁷; it may be, because we have received an
equivalent; it may be, as here, by some irreversible law outside of us,
as we talk of death as the ‘debt' of nature. ‘Debemur morti nos
nostraque‚' A. P. 62. It is not necessary to imagine with Orelli a
hesitation between the two constructions, ‘ nisi mavis perire, cave’ and
‘cave ne pereaS‚' or with Dillr„ an ἀπὸ κοινοῦ government of ‘ludi-
= brium ’ by ‘ debes’ and ⁶ cave.⁷ You could not say ‘ cavere ludibrium ‘
in the same sense of ‘ludibrium ’ in which you would say ‘ debere ludi-
brium ventis? The position of‘ eave ’ gives it the necessary emphasis.

17, 18. Here Horace seems to be thinking of the Commonwealth as
much as of the ship. The contrast is between the two moments, a few
hours ago when the ship was struggling for existence in the storm‚ and
now when it is at the haven's mouth, but still not quite safe. His
feeling towards it then was ‘a hopeless beart-sickening‚' now it is ‘a
fond yearning and anxious care.'

18. desiderium does not necessarily imply regret for what is lost or

impossible to get; see for instance, Od. 3. 1. 25 ‘ desiderantem quod
satis est!
