28. Palinurus, the south promontory of the gulf of Velia. on the
west coast of Lucania. Virg. Aen. 5. 833 foll.‚ 6. 381. It is still ‘ Punta
di Palinuro.’ There is no other allusion in Horace's poems to this
escape from shipwreck, unless his remembrance of it is the source of the
images os Od. 1. 28; see also on 2. 17. 19, 4. 4. 43 and Introd. to Epod. 1.
For ‘ Sicula unda‚’ see on 2. 12. 2.

32. litoris Assyrii, probably of the Syrian desert, Assyrius being
used loosely for ‘ Syrius' by the poets. See Od. 2. 1 1. 16, and cp. Virg.

viator, opposed to ‘navitas as ‘ viae' to ‘ mare,‘ 2. 6. 7.

33. Britannos, Catull. 11. 11 (if that be the right reading) ‘horri-
bilem insulam ultimosque Britannos?³ Tae. Ann. 14. 30 accuses the
Druids of human sacrifices.

34. Concanum, a tribe of the Cantabri. Virgil attributes the mixing
of milk with horse's blood to the Geloni (G. 3. 463& Statius to the
Massagetae (Ach. 1. 307). Silius (5. 360) joins the Massagetae and the
Concani.

35. pharetratos, Virg. Aen. S. 725 ‘sagittiferosque Gelonos’ All
the localities have epithets to express the savagery of the inhabi-
tants except ‘Scythicum amnem,' where ‘inviolatus’ has the same
effect by implying that others could not visit the Tanais with equal
sasety.

37. vos supplies the connection with the preceding stanzas, as if it
were ‘vos eaedem.' The same Muses who protect the poet are the

simul = ‘ simulac.'

38. abdidit; this is the reading of A, and is the only one which has
distinct support from a Scholiast, Acron interpreting it by ‘interius
recondidit.’ Cp. Epp. Ι. Ι. 5 of the retired gladiator, ‘latet abditus
agr0.' Orelli, following B, has ‘ addidit‚’ which is used in the same
connection, as if it were the technical word, in Tac. Ann. 13. 31 ‘ Colo-
niae Capua atque Nuceria additis veteranis firmatae sunt? Bentley sup-
ports ‘reddidit’ (which also has respectable MS. authority) by Tac.Ann.
1. 17 ‘ praetorias cohortes quae post sedecim annos penatibus suis red-
didit? In point of sense, ‘abdidit’ or ‘reddidit' is much preferable to
