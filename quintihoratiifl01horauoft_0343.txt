NOTES. BOOKII, ODE XIX. 307

ODE XIX.

The poet imagines himself (vv. 1-4) to have come, while wandering
in the hills, on Bacchus amidst the N ymphs and Satyrs. He describes
dramatically (as though he felt them at the moment) the effects of the
sight: the fresh terror (χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοὶ φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς, Hom. Il. 20.
131), the rush of inspiration3 delightful, yet half painsul, from its
tumultuous excitement. Then he finds the way of relies. He may sing
the praises of Bacchum of his power to bless those whom he loved and
destroy his enemies; his power over inanimate nature, over noxious
beasts, over the giantS‚ over the monsters of Hades.

Compare Od. 3. 25. They both seem to be attempts to catch some-
thing of the inspiration of a Greek dithyramb. That Ode has a purpose;
the present one is a mere study. There is no reason to believe that it
is a reproduction of any single original. The art of its composition,
the climax through which the celebration of Bacchus’ triumph rises.
and the studiedly quiet conclusion after the abrupt bursts of the be-
ginning, as though the strained mind had found relief and the ⁶ turbida
laetitia ’ run itself clear, are Horatian rather than Greek.

Dius. suggests that Horace had been lately reading Euripides’
Bacchae. That he had read it is pretty certain.

2. credite posteri, cp. Epod. 9. 11 ‘ posteri negabitis.‘

3. aures aeut-as. The epithet is for the eye; ‘the sharp-pointed
ears? That the Satyrs were listening is implied in the selection of their
ears as the part which the poet saw. For the Nymphs and Satyrs in
this conjunction see 1. 1. 31 ‘ Nympharumque leves cum Satyris chori.’

6. turbidum laetatur. Meineke compares an expression of Phere-
crates, Fr22 ’γελῶντα καὶ χαίροντα καῖ τεθολωμένον.

7. parce Liber. He prays the god to moderate the violence of the
overmastering ἐνθουσιασμός, not to strike him with the terrible thyrsus,
the blows of which inspired the Bacchic frenzy.

9. fas .. est. Bentley was ‹lissatisfied with the boldness of this
assertion following on the ⁴ trepidat’ and ‘parce,' and wished to read
‘ sit.’ But see what has been said in the Introduction to the Ode. It
is the expression of joy at finding a vent sor his overwrought feelings.
