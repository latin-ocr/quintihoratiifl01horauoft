THE OXF ORD BIBLE 1<OR TEACHERS.

²limans {rum &piniane (continued).

“The idea of a series os Libles in different ty,pes corresponding page
for page with oue another, is one which the Dean has long wished to see
realised for the sake of those who fini the type of their familiar copies
no longer available. ,The amount, os inform ttlon compressed into the
comparatively few pages of the Appendix is w·0n‹1e11u1. And the Dean
is glad to hear that. the help or such eminent contributum has been
available for its compilation. The Coucordanee seems to be sufficiently
rull for reference to any text that may be required! '—an. Dim* οι)

“1 have examined the Oxroao Bmts 1²01< 'temnens with very great care.
and congratulata you upon the publication of so valuable a work It eon-
tains within a reasonable compass a large mass of most usesul informa-
tion, arranged so conveniently as to be easily accessible‚ and its effect will
be not merely to aid, but aIS), I think, to stimulate the studies of the
reader. The book is also printed so beautifully‚ and is so handsome in
every way, that I expect it will be gre· itly sought after, as a most accept-
able present to any who are engaged in teaching in our Sunday Schools
and elsewhere. ‘—T1m DEAN or CANTERBL'RY.

“1 have examined with some care a considerable poi-tlon of the 'Helps
to the Study of the Bible,⁷ which are placed at the end of the Oxroai)
Bushr. FOR TEAOHERS‚ and have been much struck with the vast amount
or really useful insormation which has there been brought together in a
small compass, as well as the acemacy with which it has been compiled.
The botanical and geological notices‚ the account of the animale ot Scrip-

ture, &c.‚ seem to be excellent, and the maps are admirable. Altogether, ¹

the book cannot fail to be of service, not only to teachers, but to all who
cannot affor-d a large hb1 ary or who have not time for much independent
study! ’——Tffl=2 Diua or Parnasonouen.

“1 have been for some time well axx-are or the value of the Oxronn ant. ¹

Fon Tumens, and have been in the habit of recommending it, not only
to Sunday-School Teachers, but. to more advaneed studente on the ground
of its containing a large mass os accurate and well-digested information,
useful and in many cases indispensable to the thoughtful reader of Holy
Scripture; in fact, along with the Bible, a coplous Index, and a Concord-
ance complete enough for all ordinary purposes, this one volume includes
a series of short but comprehensive chapters equivalent to a small library
of Biblical worlts.¹'—Tflss Bisuor or Lmemcn.
