neighbour's landmark and drive out your own client to misery. Yet
more surely than any house you are building the grave awaits you.
Think os that limit—the grave, where you and your poor neighbourS,
oppressor and oppressed, are on an equality.'

Horace opposes two pictures: one; os himself, contented and happy
with his sarm and his poetry; the other, os some rich man so sull of
pians sor building and increasing his property as to forget death and to
commit wrong and robbery. Ode 15 eomplained os the great growth
os the villas of the wealthy on the ground of the waste of land which
was wanted sor agriculture. This Ode touches on another evil incidental
to this passion, the unjust and eruel ejection of small owners from their
ancestral properties. It is this which gives the special colour to the
usual satire on the folly of leaving death out of our calculationS. Death
is not only more certain than all our plans-he is the great equalizer
and redresser of wrongs.

With the picture of the grasping proprietor compare Sallust‘s ex-
pressions where he is tracing that alienation of classes which led to the
civil wars, Jug. 41 ‘populus militia atque inopia urgebatur; praedas
bellicas imperatores cum paucis diripiebant; interea parentes aut parvi
liberi militum ut quisque potentiori confinis erat sedibus pellebantur.'

The early part of the Ode is not unlike in expression a fragment (28)
of Bacchylides :—

οὐ βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός, οὔτε πορφύρεοι τάπητες, ἀλλὰ
θυμὸς εὐμενὴς
Μοῦσά τε ’γλυκεῖα καὶ Βοιωτίοισιν ἐν σκὺφοισιν οἶνος ἡδύς.

The schol„ however, are possibly right in taking the words as=‘n0n
eburnum neque aureum lacunar.’ Cp. Cic. Parad. 1. 4 ‘marmorea tecta
ebore et auro fulgentia.’

2. renidet, 2. 5. 19; cp. Lucr. 2. 27 ‘Nec domus argento fulget

columns of the ‘giallo antie0,' which was found in Numidia, ‘flavis
Nomadum metallis,’ Stat. Silv. 1. 5. 36.

3. Attali . . occupavi. This seems only to mean ‘nor has some
rich stranger lest me a palace ’ ; ‘ the palace os an Attalus ’ being a way
ofsaying ‘a palace of enormous wealthss see on Od. Ι. 1. 12 ‘Attalicis
