to turn the scale in favour of the indicative. Either construction is l

merita es, ferroque averte dolorem.
6. amica vis pastoribus, ‘the shepherds’ sturdy friend’; ‘vis’ is

taken (as Virgil's ‘odora canum vis,' Aen. 4. 132) from Lueretius’ ‘ p'er- ¹
missa canum vis‚' 4. 681, ⁶ fida canum vis,' 6. 1222, an imitation of the l

Greek use of βία. The dogs of Epirus and Sparta are named in Virg.

G. 3. 405. They are used there, as here, both for guarding the sold and Χ

for hunting.

7. agam, sc. ⁸ feram quaecunque‚' etc.. the substantive appearing with
the relative instead of in its more natural place as the antecedent, see on
Epod. 2. 37.

8. quaeeunque, whatever it be, even isit shall be you.

praecedet. Dillr. prefers the reading of a few MSS. ‘procedet ‘
(in the sense of ‘obviam veniat,’ just as ‘proiectum ’ in v. 10 seems=
‘obiectum'), in order to soften still more the change of metaphor by

daughter Neobule to Archilochus and broken his promise.

14. hostis Bupalo. Hipponax, an iambic poet who used his art to ἶ

revenge himself on Bupalus and Athenis, two sculptors of Chios and
brothers, who had caricatured his ugliness. Notiee that each of the
epithets ⁴ infidos ‘acen’ is intended, after Horace's manner, to cover to
some extent both cases. They strike again the keynote of the Epode.
The masters of iambic verse whom Horace imitates were like him,

unlike his opponent: they struck only at those who deserved it, and ;

they struck home.

15. atro dente, the ‘ venomous tooth ' of envy or malignity, Od. 4. 3. l

the destruction ofa foreign enemy, but to do the Parthian's work and ,

destroy Rome itself? Even wild beasts do not prey on their own kind.
