XX JNTRODUCTION.

‘apparatus criticus ' will convey to a reader, has guided Keller
or Holder to a conclusion which the mere inspection of the list
of MSS. on one side and the other hardly explains. But a
survey of the places where Keller's readings of the Odes and
Epodes differ from those of other recent editors will show, I
think, that his theory of the relation of the MSS. has not had
any very revolutionary effect upon his text, that he admits con-
jectures at least as largely as others, and that his conclusions,
however they were formed, are supported generally by evidence
from the Scholia or quotations‚ or by considerations of style,
metre, and the like ¹.

Before we leave the MSS. it may be in place to say a few
words upon two subjects which present themselves very early ⁵
to the reader of any notes upon Horace.

1. The first has been glanced at already. I do not know
that conjeclural emendation has really been exceptionally busy
upon Horace³s text. That the two are specially associated in
the minds of general readers is due doubtless‚ in a great mea-
sure, to their greater familiarity with the author, to the bril-
liancy of the conjectures themselves the contributions of a long
series of the greatest scholars from the Renaissance onwards,

¹ Deducting questions of orthography, punctuation, eto, there are

thirty-seven places in the Odes and Epodes where Keller's text differs ,
from that os both Ritter and Mr. Munro. Of these nine are due to his *1
introduction into the text of conjectures (Od. 1. 7. 8 ⁴ honore‚' 1. 15. 36 3
‘ Pergameas} 1. 16. 5 ⁴ adyti‚' 1. 23. 5, 6 ‘ vepris . . . ad ventum,' 3. 5. 15 ‘J

‘trahenti,’ 4. 4. 17 ‘Raetis,' 4. 10. 5 ‘Ligurine,' Epod. 2. 27 ‘ frondes‚'
5. 87 ‘humana invicem ’). Eleven are cases where readings resting on

very slight MS. authority, or even upon noxie, have been received on j

other grounds, such as the authority of the Scholia, etc. (Keller, Od. 1.
3. 37 ‘arduum,' 1.16. 8 ‘ si‚' 1. 20. 10 ‘tum‚’ 1. 22. 2 ‘Mauri‚’ 1. 22. 11
‘ expeditus‚' 2. 3. 11 ‘ quo et‚’ 2. 6. 19 ‘fertilis‚’ 3. 3. 55 ‘debacchantur';
'Ritter and Munro, 1. 17. 14 ‘hic,’ 2. 13. 23 ‘ discretas‚' 3. 4. 10 ‘ altricis· ’). ,
There are very few of the remainder where the effect of his view of the
MSS. can be distinctly detected in the absence of other arguments from
the Scholia, or from internal evidence; such are perhaps 1. 8. 2 ⁶ hoc,’
3. 21. 10 ‘necgleget‚' 4. 9. 31 ‘sileri‚’ Epod.16. 33 ‘flavos,’ 17. 60
⁴ proderit.'
