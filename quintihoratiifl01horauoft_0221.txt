NOTES. BOOKJ, ΘΟΕ Vll. 185

15. albus, predicative. The south wind is sometimes λευκόνοτος,
not always ‘niger Auster.’ The lesson is that the very same wind which
brings the clouds will presently clear them. ‘ Albus' as ‘ albus Iapyx,‘
Od. 3. 27. 193 ‘ candidi Favonii,' 3. 7. 1.

16. parturit, see on Od. 4. 5. 26.

17. sapiens, ‘be wise and remember‚' etc„ Od. Ι, 11, 6 ‘ sapias, vina
liques?

19. molli, ‘ mellow,' as ‘lene,’ Od. 3. 20. 2. It breaks the flow of
the sentence needlessly to take ‘ molli,’ with Ritter, as an imperative.

20. tenent . . . tenebit, ‘ as now‚' ‘ as by and bye‚’ stress is clearly
laid on the tenses, so that apparently Plancus was now, or might be sup-
posed to be, campaigning.

21 foll. This story of Teucer is not found elsewhere, beyond the fact
of his being ill-received by his father Telamon because he returned
without Ajax, and of his founding Salamis in Cyprus. Cicero may
possibly be referring to a common source in Tusc. 5. 37 ‘ad omnem
rationem Teucri vox accommodari potest: Patria est ubicunque est
bene)

22. eum fugeret, when he was starting on his banishment, not
“ during his flight,' as though he had put in to shore for the night,
as some commentators suppose, see on v. 32.

23. populea, sacred to Hercules, to whom as a wanderer Teucer
would offer sacrifice 3 ‘vagus Hercules‚’ Od. 3. 3. 9. Orelli quotes
Xenophon, Anab. 6. 2. 9, who speaks of sacrificing τῷ ἡγεμόνι Ἡρακλεῖ.

27. duee et auspice, ‘under Teucer's conduct and Teucer’s εἴξῃ-ξ a
curious technicality of Roman military life to put into Teucer's mouth.
‘ Ductu et auspicio‚’ Liv. 6. 12 ; ‘domuit partim ductu partim auspiciis
suis Cantabriam,' etc, Suet. Oct. 21. The two did not necessarily belong
to the same person. The auspices were taken in the name of the Im-
perator, and the ‘felicitas' was his, see Od. 4. 14. 33 foll. Horace has
not exactly reproduced the technical phrase, for we find ‘auspiciis
Camilli, Augusti,5 etc.‚ not ‘auspice Camillo.' ‘Auspex’ is used else-
where either of the person who attends the imperator and actually takes
the atispiceS, or if in the sense of ‘ patron,' then only of some god who
by omens or otherwise sanctioris an enterprise. Meanwhile a certain
amount of doubt hangs over the reading. Paris A, with a few other
MSS„ has ‘ auspice Teucri‚’ and Acron's note looks as if he had found
that reading: ‘auspice Fautore vel suasore, Apollinem dicit cuius re—
sponsa vel promissa sequebatur? Victorinus (fourth century), who is
quoted in defence of the vulg„ gives no support .to it. He only quotes
the line sor its metre, and two of the best MSS. of his work read ‘ Teucri.'
Keller accepts that reading. It must then mean ‘ under the guidance of
Teucer and of Teucer’s patron,' sc. Apollo; but ‘ auspex’ in this sense
