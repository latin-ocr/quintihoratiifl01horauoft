 

THE SCHOLIASTS. xxv

On the other hand, we find in them the change of tense already
noticed with respect to sacrifices, etc.‚ which would point to
their being later than the prohibition of heathen ceremonies by
Theodosius in A.D. 391 3 we find (unless these be interpolations)
the names of the Goths (on Od. 4. 15. 22) and, according to one
MS„ of the Huns (on Od. 2. 11. 1), and a hint perhaps of the
desolation of Italy by the barbarians (on Od. 3. 4. 16) ; and we
find, subject to the same proviso, references to Priscian (5th
century) on Epp. 2. 1. 228, and to Priscian’s teacher Theoctistus
on Sat. 1. 5. 97. It is mainly on those grounds that Keller
distinguishes the Acron who was one of the commentators used
by Porphyrion from the composer or composers of the Scholia
which now bear the name, and which were composed by some
one who had Porphyrion's commentary in his hands and used
it largely. These Pseudo-Acronian Scholia he relegates to the
5th century. Upon grounds on which it is less easy to feel

secure in following him, he divides them into two parts; the
first (up to the beginning of the Fourth Book of the Odes with

part of those in the Fourth Book and most of the Epodes)
belonging to the earlier half of the century ; the remainder he
places in the second half, and identifies as their author Fabius
Planciades Fulgentius, a grammarian of that date, one of whose
= works, three books of mythology, is found with no mark of a
new author on the same MS. with the Schol. Acron.

The so-called ‘Commentator Cruquianus’ is not an inde-
pendent authority, the name being given to a medley of notes,
in the main a transcript or paraphrase of Acron and Por-
phyrion, printed by Cruquius from marginal or interlinear
annotations on his Blandinian MSS.

It may be convenient for purposes of reference to add a
chronological list of the chief editions of Horace earlier than

the present century (chiefly from Mitscherlich).
