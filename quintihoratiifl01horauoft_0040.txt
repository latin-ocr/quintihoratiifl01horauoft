4 INTRODUCTION TO THE

estimating the value of these it is of course necessary to be sure
of the nature of the allusion. We are in danger of confusing
poetry with history when we look too closely into every mention
of Dacian or Indian and search the pages of Dio or Strabo for
some detail that will exactly suit it. Horace’s verses are full of
the feeling of the greatness of the Roman empire, the remoteness
of its frontiers, the immense charge which Caesar has taken on
himself. And the names of distant and unknown places and tribes
had a spell in ancient times which they have lost in days of maps
and geography. Even when we come to more definite references,
as those to the quarrels of Phraates and Tiridates, or to the
frequent risings of the Cantabri, though we have here ample
ground for dating generally the period during the course of which ³
the poems must have been composed, and exactly, if we know
the date ofa special event referred to, in the year before which the
particularpoem could not have been composed, we yet soon get to
the point where the event has become a standing illustration of ’
the vicissitudes of fortune or a statesman’s anxietieS, a poetical ·‚
commonplace which may recur till it is supplanted by some,
fresh circumstance which strikes the poet's imagination.

To this it must be added that the foreign history of the time
is imperfectly known to us, and that some uncertainty hangs
over the dates of several of those events which are known.

ᾧ 5. It may be convenient and may save some repetitions to
give shortly in this place the few facts which are known with
respect to the Cantabrians, the Dacians, and Scythians, and the
Parthians, ‘to which, if to any known historical events, allusions
in these Books must have reference.

ξ 6. The Cantabri, a tribe living in the mountains of the
northern coast of Spain, are named by Dio (51. 20), with their
neighbours the Astures, as in arms against Rome at the time of Ἴ
the general pacification in B.C. 29, and as being conquered in
that year by Statilius Taurus. The next mention of thern is in
B.C. 26 (Dio 53. 25), in which year the news of their rising
reached Augustus in Gaul, and diverted him (see above, §3) ·
from his intended expedition to Britain. He was commanding
in person against them in ΒΕ. 25, but fell ill and was detained
