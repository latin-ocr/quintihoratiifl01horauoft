own on which he can entertain a guest. The name of Pompeius suggests
that he may have followed, after the battle of Philippi, the fortunes of
Sextus Pompeius, who maintained the war by sea against the Triumvirs
till the year ae. 35.

Line 1. tempus in ultimum, Catuli. 64. 151 ‘supremum ‘tempus'
169 ‘extremum tempus,' ‘utmost peril.’ ‘Tempus’=tcacpbs‚ a crisis,
time of special import.

2. deducte . . duee, perhaps (as Dillr. and Ritter think) with a slight
play on the two words, as though that were the point to which Brutus'
leadership led them.

3. quis redonavit? merely a question of wonder, ‘how came you
here?' not intended to be answered by ‘Maecenas’ or ‘Augustus’ This
wonder at seeing Pompeius safe again is the thought which gives its
unity to the poem. ‘A god saved me, but Ι saw you carried back
again into the stormy sea; what can have rescued you? What limits
can we set to our gratitude or to our rejoicing ?' ‘ Redonare ' is a word
only found in Horace, see Od. 3. 3. 33.

Quiritem, ‘a full Roman citizen'; ‘ capite non deminutum,' Dillr„
Orell.‚ Ritter. Conington in his Translation takes it as opp. to ‘miles,'
‘a man of peace,' supporting it by the story of Julius Caesar reducing
the mutinous loth legion to order by addressing them as ⁶ Quirites,’ the
term implying that they were disbanded, Suet. J. C. 70.

prime, ⁶ praecipue,' Aer. Ritter would interpret it ‘ earliest‚' object-
ing that Pompeius would not be ranked before Varius, Virgil, Maecenas,

etc. ; but Horace is thinking only of the old days of their acquaintance >

in the camp, when Pompeius may well have been the ‘ chiefest of his
companions.’

6. morantem fregi, see on 1. 1. 20. This can hardly have been
during the actual campaign in Macedonia, but it is probable that
Horace, while in Brutus' army, was in Asia; see Mssman’s Life of
Horace, p. 17, and on Sat. 1. 7, and Epp. 1. 11. 6.

7. coronatus nitentes, ‘with a garland on my hair glistening with
Syrian persume.' ‘ Dat et Malobathron Syria, arborem folio convoluto
arido colore: ex quo exprimitur oleum ad unguenta,’ Plin. N. H.
12. 5 .

10.9 non bene; there is the same irony in the dimin. ⁸ parmula,' ‘ my
poor little shield’3 cp. Epod. 1. 16 ‘Imbellis ac firmus pamm,’ and
contrast Epp. 1. 20. 23 ‘Me primis urbis belli placuisse domique.’
That Horace should have been able playfully to¹ impute cowardice
to himself is enough, as Lessing pointed out, to prove that he had no
sear that others would impute it to him. He is clearly thinking, as his
