NOTES. BOOK J, ODE HJ. 175

ponere, the wind ‘lays’ the waves when it ceases to blow; Virg.
Aen. 5. 763 ‘ placidi straverunt aequora venti⁷; Soph. Aj. 674 δεινῶν
ἅημα πνευμάτων ἔκοὶμισε στένοντα πόντον.

17. quem gradum. To fear the step. the sootsalh of death would
be a natural expression, and the personification suits v, 33, where death
‘corripit gradum'3 ‘quem gradum¹ must then mean, ‘What kind os
sootsall?⁷ ‘the approach of death in what guise?’ It has also been
taken (1) as parallel to ‘leti via‚’etc.=‘quem aditum ad mortem':
(2) by the Scholiasts‚ who are followed by Gesner, as = ‘ what degree of
death? ³ i. e. what death is so terrible that he feared it if he feared not
the sea?

18. siccis, ξηροῖς ἀκλαύστοις ὄμμασιν, Aesch. S. c. T. 696. Bentley,
aster Heinsius, would alter ‘siccis' to ‘ rectis‘ <Cunningham proposed
‘tixis') with no MS. authority, on the ground that tears are not with
ns the natural indication of terror. But Orelli quotes, amongst other
passageS, Ov. Met. 11. 539, of a sfflpwreck, ‘ Non tenet hic lacrimas,
stupet hic? W'hen the panic falls on the Suitors in Hom. Od. 20. 349,
their eyes δακρυόφιν πίμπλαντο.

monstra natantia, Od. 3. 27. 27 ⁶ scatentem Beluis pontum,’ one of
the stock dangers of the sea, perhaps helped to become conventional in
poet-ry by the popular misunderstanding of Homer's μεγακητέα πόντον,
cp. 4. 14. 47.

20. infames, δυσωνύμους, with reference perhaps to their terrible
name, ‘the headlands of thunder.' They were proverbial for storms
and shipwrecks, Virg. G. 1. 332.

Acroceraunia. After Horace's manner he names a special dangerous
headIand, as he has a special wind in v. 12, a special sea in v. 15. They
are all, however, actual dangers which Virgil himself must encounter
in passing from Brundusium to Dyrrhachium.

22. prudens, ⁶ in his providence,’ Od. 3. 29. 29.

dissociabili, ‘estranging'; cp. the active use of ‘ illacrymabilis ’ in
Od. 2. 14. 6, though Horace himself uses it passively in Od. 4. 9. 26;
‘so ⁶ penetrabilisff Virg. G. 1. 933 ‘genitabilis,’ Lucret. 1. 11. Ritter
and others deny this active use, and render it by ἄξενοςς but it is formed
upon the verb ¹ dissociare ' and must mean either ‘ able to sever‚' as here,
or ‘ able to be severed‚' as in Claud. Ruf. 2. 258 ‘non dissociabile corpus.³

23. impiae, pred. ‘in their impiety.'

24. transiliunt, ‘ leap lightly over.’ The word is expressive. as
Ritter says, ‘et levitatis et impudentiae.' Cp. its use in Od. 1. 18. 5,
and Sil. Pun. 4. 71, of Hannibal, ‘qui sacros montes rupesque pro—
fundas Transiluit.’

25. Ρθτρθτὶετλῆνᾳι, uniting the ideas of ‘to bear' and ‘to dare?
Compare the tone os Soph. Ant. 333 foll.
