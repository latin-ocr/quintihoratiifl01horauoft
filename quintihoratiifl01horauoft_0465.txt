it in one of these ways as a natural exaggeration; but, aster the actual
event, the ‘ burning os Carthage' in a Roman’s mouth can hardly mean
anything but its burning by Scipio Africanus Minor at the end of the
Third Punic War, in ΒΑ). 146, seventeen years after the death of the
elder Scipio, and five years aster the death of his friend the poet Ennius,
who in his Annales wrote a poetical account of the Second Punic VVar.
W'e cannot accuse Horace of confusing the two Scipios‚ and (as Bentley
points out) the critical contemporaries who heard and read his poems
of tolerating the confusion. Nor are the conjectural emendations
‘impendia’ (Cunningham), ‘stipendia' (Doring)‚ ‘ In dispendia’ (Her-
mann), likely or happy. Bentley condemns the line as a monkish inter-
polation, on metrical as well as historical grounds, and it is the first and
most obvious victim of those who wish to reduce the Ode to conformity
with Meineke's canon; see Index of Metres‚ ξ 6. It remains to inter-
pret the lines as they stand, and the difficulties do not seem to be as
great as they have been represented. If we wish (with Ritter) to make
Africanus Major the subject of the whole comparison, then the burning
os Carthage will be adduced, not as his act, but as the crown and corn-
pletion by one of his name of his victorieS, as something which might
be supposed to revive and keep alive his fame. ‘Not marble monu-
ments, not his great feats of arms, not the completest posthumous
success of his policy and hereditary transmission of his farne, win sor
him the glory that Ennius' poetry wins for him.‘ The truth, however,
is perhaps that Horace is (not confusing, but) consciously uniting the
two Scipios. ‘What throws most glory on the name of Africanus?
Zama and the destruction of Carthage, or Ennius’ poetry ? ' ‘ Eius qui . .
rediit‚' is merely a periphrasis for the name ‘Africanus‚‘ and Horace
could have used it apparently of the younger Scipio, as he uses of him
in Sat. 2. 1. 65 the periphrasis ⁴ qui Duxit ab oppressa meritum Car-
thagine nomen.' Cp. the words which Cicero puts into the mouth of
Scipio Africanus Major as addressed to his grandson, ‘ Hanc [Cartha-
ginem] evertes, eritque cognomen id tibi per te partum quod habes
adhuc a nobis hereditarium‚’ Somn. Scip. 11. In favour of this view
vis the fact already pointed out, that the sentiment is really general,
‘ famous deeds' are specialised‚ aster Horace’s manner, into ‘the deeds
of the two Scipios,' and poetry is specialised into the poetry of (or such
as that of) Ennius; but we may remember that Scipio’s exploits were
only the last in the long series of glories which formed the subject of
Ennius‘ poem. That it stopped short of Africanus Minor is a fact that
Horace might ignore.

15. fugae . . minae. The flight of Hannibal from Italy, and the
return on his own head, by Scipio's invasion of Africa, of the threats he
had offered to Rome ¹by his invasion of Italy.
