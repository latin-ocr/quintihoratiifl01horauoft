410 HORATII CARMJNA.

victim of his unfleshed tooth ;-such has Drusus been in his campaign
in Vindelicia—noble by inherited excellence, noble also by his royal

rearing. Rome's gratitude to the house of the Neros is summed up in the ,

memory of Metaurus, the turning-point of the terrible Punic war, when

Hasdrubal was routed, and the traces of war vanished, and Hannibal .

himself bore witness to Rome’s vitality. “It is madness for us to pursue
our enemy; more than enough if we can escape their pursuit. From
the fires of their native Troy, from the hardships of the long voyage to
Italy, they have but drawn strength and stubbornneSS‚ like the oak on
Algidus which the woodman lops, or the hydra ever growing again to
baffle the patience of Hercules. All hope is gone for ever, and buried
with Hasdrubal.'' And the conqueror was an ancestor of the Neros.
Jupiter protects the race, and Augustus directs their campaigns. What
may we not expect from their arms? ’

Nero Claudius Drusus. the younger of the two sons of Livia Drusilla, ’

by her first husband, Tiberius Claudius Nero, was born in Augustus'
house, 3.(3. 38, three months after his mother's divorce and remarriage.
He was by far the most popular of the two brothers. In B.c. 16, when
Augustus set out sor Gaul, taking with him Tiberius, who was praetor
at the time, Drusus was appointed to discharge the duties of the office
during his brother's absence (Dio 54. 19). Of his expedition in the
following year against the Raeti, some account will be found in the
Introd. to this Book. He died, six years afterwards, from the effect of
a fall from his horse, while engaged in the last of three campaigns
beyond the Rhiue, which gained for him the posthumous title of
Germanicus.

Line Ι. qualem, so v. 13 ‘qualemve'; the apodosis is ‘in v. 17,
‘ talem’ being suppressed. The purpose of the two similes is different:
the first describes the birth and training of the young warrior prince‚
the second the astonishment of the enemy when they saw him, and
knew instinctively that they were to be the first victims of his maiden
sword.
