NOTES. BOOKI, ODEI. 165

16. 1-4, where the point is the same, ‘Otium Divos rogat in patenti
Prensus Aegaeo.' Dilleuburger points out the triple contrast between
the two lives, of danger, aud of peace (‘otium’); at sea, and in the
country (‘rur:1'); of wandering, and of rest at home (‘ oppidi sui’).

18. quassas, though their state bears witness to the risks of the
trade.

pauperiem. The ‘pauperies‚’ which the trader is represented here
and in Epp. 1. 1. 45 as flying ‘per mare, per saxa, per ignes,' is not
‘want’ (⁴ egestas'), but a modest competence, such as Horace tells us
was the school of the ancient Roman heroisin, Od. 1. 12. 44 ‘Saeva
paupertas et avitus apto Cum lare sundus,’ such as he attributes to his
own father, Sat. 1. 6. 71 ‘ macro pauper agello)

pati, for the inf. see App. 2. ξ 2.

19. Massici, a wine grown near Sinuessa in Campania.

20. solido de die. He is speaking probably not of letting the
festivities of the evening encroach on the day’s work (‘ tempestivum
convivium: Cic. pro Mur. 6, ete.), but of breaking the continuity os
business hours. Compare sor the metaphor‚ Van. R. R. 1. 2 ‘diffin-
dere insititio somno meridiem] and Horace himself, Od. 2. 7. 6,7
‘ morantem saepe diem mero Fregi.’ Seneca was probably thinking of
this place when he wrote, Ep. 83, ‘ hodiernus dies solidus est, nemo ex
illo mihi quidquam eripuit.'

22. lene, not so loud as to disturb slumber.

eaput, Virg. G. 4. 368 ¹ caput unde altus primum se erumpit
Enipeus?

sacrae. All springs were sacred. Cp. Od. 3. 13. The epithet
recalls the qualities which gave them that character—the beauty, fresh-
ness, abundance.

23. lituo tubae, ‘ stridor lituum clangorque tuba1·um,⁷ Luc. 1. 237.
The ‘lituus' was a curved horn emitting a shrill note, used by the
cavalry—the ‘ tuba' was straight, and belonged to infantry.

²4· matribus detestata, cp. Epod. 16. 8 ¹ parentibusque abominatus
Hannibal? Cicero uses ‘detestatus’ as a passive, De Legg. 2. 11.

25. manet, ‘stays all night;' cp. Sat. 2. 3. 234 ‘ Tu nive Lucana
dormis oeieatus ut aprum Cenem ego?

Iove, of the air, Od. 1. 22. 20, 3. 10. 8, Epod. 13. 23 cp. Virg. G.
1. 418 ‘ Iuppiter uvidus,’ and G. 3. 435 ‘sub divo?

28. teretes, ‘ os closetwisted cord,‘ not loose in texture and ragged3
so that it is equivalent to ⁶ strong.’

Marsw, for the form, see on Od. 1. 15. 10.

29. doctarum, i.e. a poet's. The epithet is derived from the σοφὸς
ἀοιδός of heroic times, ὃν Μοῦσ’ ἐδίδαξε (Hom. Od. 8. 481), the Muse,
the daughter of Memory. The poet learnt and remembered rather than
