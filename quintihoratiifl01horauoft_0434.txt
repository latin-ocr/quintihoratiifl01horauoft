Line 1. exegi, ‘finished.'

aere = ‘ aereis statuis.'

2. situ, ‘ construction‚' an unusual sense of the word, as it is generally
used of the site of a building, not of its erectiori. Dillr. quotes Tac.
Ann. 3. 38 ‘ Philippopolim a Macedone Philippo sitam.'

3. impotens, of unrestrained violence. Cp. Epod. 16. 62 ‘impotentia
astri‚' Od. 1. 37. 10.

5. fuga; cp. 2. 1. 41, and see on 2. 5. 13. Ritter points out that
there is the suggestion of a double metaphor of the destructive effects
of time, ‘si quidem memoria annorum aut annorum serie obruitur aut
fuga temporum abripitur.'

6. multa, as Ovid in the same connection, ⁶ parte . . meliore mei.’

que; see on 1. 27J16.

7. Libitinam; Sat. 2. 6. 19, Epp. 2. 1. 49. Not merely ‘death‚’
but ‘the funeral rues? Cp. Od. 2. 20. 21 foll.

8. crescam laude, as ‘ secundis laboribus crevit‚’ 4. 4. 45.

reeens, ‘ever fresh? not half-forgotten. Epp. 2. 1. 54 ‘Naevius in
manibus non est et mentibus haeret Paene recens?'

dum Capitolium, etc.‚ ⁵ as long as Rome stands? which to a Roman
is as much as to say ‘ sor ever? The ⁵ virgo ' is doubtless a vestaL the
singular number probably having reference to the ‘Virgo Maxima-l
The special ceremony referred to is thought to be one which took place
on the Ides of March, when prayers were offered in the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus for the salubrity of the coming year, and other
rites were performed under the superiritendence of the Pontifex Maximus
and the Virgo Maxima, or chief of the Vestals. The fact rests mainly
on a statement in the fragment ⁵ De Mensibus,' of Jo. Lydus (a Byzan-
tine writer of the 6th century, quoted by Preller, Romische Mythologie‚
p. 320). “

10 foll. It is a question whether ⁴ qua violens‚' etc„ qualifies ‘dicar'
(‘ many shall say of me on the banks of my native Aufidus, that I was the
first‚' etc.) or ‘ princeps deduxisse ' (‘ Ι shall be spoken of as one who by
the banks of Aufidus was the first to,' etc.) The last is the more likely.
Horace wishes his birthplace to be remembered in his own fame, ‘longe
sonantem natus ad Aufidum,’ 4. 14. 2; but he is claiming world-wide
fame, not merely to be remembered in his birthplace. There is a further
question as to the construction of ‘ex humili potens.’ Most editors
have taken it of Horace himself, ‘raised from humility to glory‚' com-
paring Epp. 1. 20. 20 ‘ Me libertino natum patre et in tenui re Maiores
pennas nido extendisse? Bentley prefers to refer the words to Daunus,
as describing his rise. The story made him an Illyrian exile, who
became King of Apulia. 1f it be taken so, Horace must still be think-
ing of himself, and seeing a likeness of his own fortunes in those of Daunus.
