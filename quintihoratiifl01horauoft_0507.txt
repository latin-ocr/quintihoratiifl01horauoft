tion'; cp. Sat. 1. 5. 41 ‘animae, quales neque candidiores Terra tulit
neque quis me sit devinctior alter‚' ‘ souls of such sort as never walked
the earth more purely white‚' etc.
ἢ 60. laborarint, potential. The reading of V and MSS. of Porph.‚

‘laborarunt,' has also strong authority.

61. quid accidit Ρ She perceives that her spells have failed.

62. venena Medeae, philtres such as Medea⁷s‚ as ‘flammis Colchicis,’
v. 24.

63. Cp. Epod. 3. 13.

superbam is the reading of V, and sound and sense support it.
But ‘ superba,' the reading of B, has almost better authority, as it was
found by Acr„ who interprets ‘ potens.'

67. latens asperim ‘1 have not omitted any herb of powe1, because
it was hard to find or grew in a difficult place?

69, Ὃ. The best interpretation seems to be, ‘the bed he sleeps on has
been smeared with a drug to make him forget all other mistresses.'1t

is a continuation of hers assurances to herself, that no precaution has
been omitted.

71. ah ah! The truth suddenly occurs to her.

solutum Ο(1. 1. 2.7 21.

ambulat, ‘w alks where he u 111 ; i.e. is not bound by the spell to
come to me.

75. nec vocata . . vocibus, ‘nor shall -it be at the summons of
Marsian spells that thy heart shall come back to me‚' ⁴ Marsis vocibus'
corresponding to ‘usitatis potionibus’ in the last clause, both being
answered by ‘ Maius parabo, maius infundam,' etc. This interpretation
gives a more continuous sense than the old one, which Ritter still sup-
ports, ‘nor shall thy heart go back again (i.e. from me), though sum-
moned by Marsian spells.‘ The Marsi were famous in sorcery; Epod.
17. 29, Virg. Aen. 7. 750 foll.
⁴ 77. maius parabo, sc. ‘quiddam' Only the second ‘maius’ goes
with ‘ poculum.'

infundam, ‘ Ι will mix.’

79. inferius, the last two syllables coalescet see on Epod. 2. 35.

82. atris, of the smoky flame of the burning bitumen. With these
two lines cp. Virg. E. 8. 80-83.

83. sub haee, ‘immediately on hearing this'; Sat. 2. 8. 83. Canidia's
words have made him despair of life, but he will curse her before he
dies. The editors compare the behaviour of Drusus towards Tiberius,
in Tac. Ann. 6. 24 ‘ ubi exspes vitae fuit meditatas compositasque diras
imprecabatur.¹

85. dubius unde, etc. His doubt was Dido's, Virg. Aen. 4. 371
‘ Quae quibus anteferam?’
