NOTES. BOOKIII, ODE IV. 331

48. unus, for all their variety they have one ruler.

aequo, calm and just. It is the key-note of the stanza; it heightens
our idea of his power, and describes its nature. The construction is,
‘qui temperat terram et mare, et regit urbes regnaque‚’ etc.

49. Newman criticiseS, not without justice, the inconsistency between
this stanza and the last. ‘ Magnum illa terrorem intulerat’ mars the
effect of the picture of imperial calm. Jove, it would seem, was
frightened; the ultimate victory was due to other gods. Horace almost
seems to sorget that he has localised the majcsty of heaven in Jupiter.
His object now is to exalt Pallas, the representative of mind. The
power of heaven was cowed, but the mind was unshaken.

50. fidens brachiis, χείρεσσι πεποιθότες, Hom. Il. 12. 135 ; but
Horace intends, by the collocation of ‘ horrida,' to give the force of‘ fidens
brachiis quibus horrebat! It is of the hundred-handed giant and his
fellows that he is thinking.

51. fratres, Otus and Ephialtes. Hom. Od. 11. 307 foll.

tendentes imposuisse. This is quoted by Madv. (L. G. ξ 407, obs.
2) with Virg. Aen. 6. 77 ‘si pectore possit Excussisse deum‚' for the
poetical use U like the Greek aorist ’) of the perf. inf. for the pres. inf.;
but they both seem to come under the regular use (which he distin-
guishes in his Opusc. Academ. 2. 119), in cases where there is definite
reference to a completed action. The object in view was not only to
place Pelion on Olympu5‚ but to leave it standing there. This reference
is clear in the old use of the perf. inf. after ‘volo ⁵ in prohibitions (‘ne
quis habuisse velit,’ Serum de Bacch. So Horace, ‘N e quis humasse
velit,' S. 2. 3. 187 ; it is analogous to the perf. conj. in direct prohibition.
This, and not any aoristic use, seems to be the explanation of ‘ ne libeat
iacuisse,’ in Virg. G. 3. 436). So also in the use after ‘ nolo,’ Sat. Ι. 2.
28; ‘malo,' S. 2. 8. 79; ‘ curo,7 Epp. 1. 17. 5, 1. 18. 59; ‘eaveo,’ A. P.
168. So, again, in ‘veraces cecinisse‚’ C. S. 25: ‘licet dixisse,’ Od. 3,
29. 43; ‘gaudet pepulisse,’ 3. 18. 153 ‘gaudet posuisse,' 1. 34. 163
‘iuvat collegisse‚' 1. 1. 4.

opaco Olympo, ‘frondosum Olympum,' Virg. G. 1. 282 ; Πήλιον
εἰνοσίφυλλον, Hom. Od. 1 1. 304. Horace has returned to the Homeric
arrangement of the mountains (omitting Ossa), which virgil had in-
verted. But in so doing he has left the epithet with what, in his
arrangement, is the least appropriate substantive. In Homer and virgil,
the ‘nodding woods' on the top add to the picture.

52. The labouring rhythm of the line is probably meant to be imitative.
