xxii JNTRODUCTJON.

be remembered therefore that to have learnt to distrust a
method is not to deny the genius of those who used it, and
who, by showing us its results at its best, have taught us the
limits of its capability. The solid value of Bentley’s edition
is diminished very little, if at all, by the fact that very many
of his conclusions are such as we cannot now accept with any
confidence or even accept at all. There is hardly a question in
Horatian exegesis that is not raised by him, and raised, if at
times· in a form rather more logical than befits the criticism
of a poet, yet always with a precision and strength, as well

as with a fulness of knowledge, which at least (and it is an ,

editor²s chief function) makes us understand and measure
the difficulty.

2. To the constructive criticism of previous centuries has
been added in the present one the destructive criticism ofwhich
the chief examples are to be found in the edition of H. Peerl-

kamp (Harlem, 18543 Amsterdam, 1862) and in the work of Ἴ
Gruppe, Minos: 'uber die Interpolationen in den romischen ,

Dichtern, Leipzig, 1859. This, like the former, proposes to ς

carry us back beyond the age of MSS. or Scholia ; unlike the '¹

former, it cannot even appeal to indications of disturbance in ᾗ

the MSS. which would explain, if they did not require, its ’ᾖ
theories. The antecedent probability of defects in the arche· ¹

type wrongly filled up cannot be denied in the face of evidence 1
that such defects must actually have existed: it becomes a
question of less or more. But the antecedent probability of ¹

the suppositions which are necessary to any theory of the ⁴
interpolation of spurious Odes or parts of Odes cannot be so ¹

easily granted. Every known fact in the history of Horace's
poems can be explained without such a theory, unless indeed ’
it be assumed that no poem or stanza which falls below his
highest poetical level can be genuine. On the other hand, as
ΜΓ. Munro points out¹, in his vigorous summary of the argu-
ments against the interpolation theory, the sorny of Horace's
poems is specially his own. We are asked to imagine that
