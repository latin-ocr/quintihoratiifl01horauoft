“ NOTES. BOOKJ‚ ODE XVII. 207

Line 1. Lucretilem. This name probably covers the whole mass os
mountain between the Licenza valley and the Campagna-the highest
point os which is now called Monte Gennaro. See Burn’s Rome and the
Campagna, 1). 431.

2. mutat. It is more usual to put the thing {alem in exchange in the
abl„ as in the last Ode, v. 26 ⁵ mutare tristia mitibus’; but Horace
often inverts thern as here and in Od. 3. Ι. 47 ‘Cur valle permutem
Sabina Divitias operosiores’3 cp. Od. 2. 12. 21, Epod. 9. 27, Sat. 2. 7,
109. The abl. in either case is analogous to the abl. of price, the trans-
action being regarded from the side, in the first case, of the seller, in the
second of the biiyer.

Lycaeo Faunus. Horace identifies (see on Od. 2. 17. 28) the Latin
Faunus, the legendary son of Picus, and giver of oracles tVirg. Aen. 7.
48, 81), the god of agriculture and cattle (Hor. Od. 3. 18), with the
Arcadian Pan, ὀρειβάτης, the inventor of the pipe (see v. 10). Cp. Ovid,
Fast. 2. 267 foll„ and esp. v. 424 ⁶ Faunus in Arcadia templa Lycaeus
habet.’ ⁶ Lycaeus’ is amountain in Arcadia.

3. defendit, Virg. E. 7. 47 ⁶ Solstitium pecori defendite.'

4. usque. The ‘frequent’ visits of Faunus have conferred ‘ per-
petual' salubrity on Lucretilis.

5. tutum, pred„ ⁴ without risk, sor it is safe in his guardianship.’
Bentley is needlessly offended at the repetition, and would read ‘ totum?
Ritter points out‘that stress is laid on the quiet and security of the
place3 there are no vipers nor wolves for the goats, no tipsy Cyrus for
Tyndaris.

arbutos, the bushes, not the berries, sor it was the leaves that the
kids liked, Virg. G. 3. 300 ‘ frondentia capris Arbuta sufficere?

6. latentes . . deviae. The two adj. are correlative, and so really
belong each to both clauses. The arbutus may be hidden in a thicket
of other shrubs, the thyme may grow only in nooks, but the goats may
stray safely to search for both.

7. uxores, Virg. E. 7. 7 ‘ Vir gregis ipse caper'; G. 3. 125 ‘pecori
maritum.'

8. virides, possibly, as Orelli and Ritter think, with the idea that
the colour indicated their poisonous character. But any epithet makes
a danger more terrible which helps our imagination to realize any of its
circumstances more vividly.

9. Martiales», an habitual epithet, as Virg. Aen. 9. 566 ⁶ Martius
lupus’3 but doubtless some correspondenee is intended between the
qualities of the wolves and the fierce god to whom they belong ; see on
1. 22. 13.

Haedssiae. The, oldest MSS. vaiy only between ‘haediliae' and
‘haediliaj Acron read the latter, and interprets it ‘ Septa hedomm.'
