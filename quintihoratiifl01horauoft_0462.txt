thought cp. Catull. 5. 5 ¹ Soles occidere et redire possunt: Nobis quum-
semel occidit brevis lux Nox est perpetua una dormienda! ’ ’

15. pater. The reading of V, though a majority of MSS. read ‘pius’
As the more habitual Virgilian epithet, the latter is the more likely to
have been substituted. The MSS. also vary between the order ‘Tullus
dives ’ and ‘dives Tullus.' The epithet is intended, probably, for both
kings‚ princely wealth being part of the traditions of the monarchy.
The general expression (cp. Epp. 1. 6. 27 ‘ Ire tamen restat, Numa quo
devenit et Ancus ⁵) is aster Lucr. 3. 1037 ‘ Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus
Ancus reliquit‚’ that being from Ennius, Ann. 150.

16. pulvis et. umbra, the conjunction perhaps from Soph. El. 1158
ἀντὶ φιλτάτης μορφῆς σποδόν τε καὶ σκιὰν ἀνωφελῆ.

17. adiiciant, ‘may be adding,' in their counsels.

hodiernae summae, ‘the total os our days, as it stands to-day.' The
Bland. V. (cp. the last Ode, v. 21) has, this time in company with
several other MSS„ ‘vitae' instead of ‘summae,' which can hardly be
anything but a gloss. For ‘summae' in this connection cp. 1. 4. 15.

19. manus avidas heredis. Newman remarks on this and similar
expressions (as 2. 3. 20, 2. 14. 25), that the state of feeling which they
indicate belongs to the bachelorhood of the wealthy Romans. ‘Amico
dare animo ’ is apparently a translation of φίλῃ ψυχῇ χαρίζεσθαιε* genio
indulgere'; Simonides, ξ 85, enforcing the same lesson from the short-
ness of life, σὺ ταῦτα μαθὼν βιότου ποτὶ τέρμα Ψυχῇ τῶν ἀγαθῶν τλῆθι,
χαριζόμενος.

21. splendida. The magnificence‚ stateliness, of Minos' court is
transferred to the decrees he passes. Homer describes hini Od. 11. 568
Διὸς ἀγλαὸν υἱὸν Χρύσεον σκῆπτρον ἔχοντα θεμιστεύοντα νέκυσσιν.

23. Torquate. The personal address implies that Torquatus pos·
sesses the gifts of which Horace speaks. With ‘ facundia’ Orelli com-
pares the hint in Epp. Ι. 5. 9, ‘Moschi causam‚' that Torquatus was a
forensic orator.

25—28. Two instances from mythology of the irrevocable nature of
death. The emphatic words are ‘pudicum' and ‘ caro,’ and there is a
certain antithesis between the two stories. Hippolytus, innocent and
the victim of his chastity,—yet Diana, the goddess of chasffly, could
not save him; Pirithous the guilty one of the pair (see 3. 4. 79),—
Theseus’ love made him share Pirithous* enterprise, and sor a time he
shared his punishment3 but when he was set free himself by Hercules,
all his love could not free Pirithous also. In the story of Hippolytus
as told by Virg. Aen. 7. 765 soll. and Ov. Met. ¹5- 479 soll„ Diana's
efforts are successful, for he is the person whom Aesculapius recalled to·
life,· but this is unknown to the Greek ltgend as it appears in Euripides'.
Hippolytus, which Horace here follows.
