NOTES. BOOKIII‚ ODE IX. 347

take ‘ privatus ' as: ‘ quum sis privatus: ¹ since you are‚' etc.; but surely
Horace would not undervalue the public character of Maecenas' offices,
however informal and unknown to the law they might be. He would
’ not after saying ‘you have on your shoulders the whole weight of home
and foreign policy‚' add, ‘ after all you are only an “ eques‚” it is
nothing to you if public affairs go wrong.’ Bentley is equally unsatisfac—
tory3 he thinks that ‘ privatus cavere,' ‘to be anxious for your private
interests‚' answers to the ‘ public care ’ of the preceding verse.

27. et. B, and most os the tenth century MSS„ omit the copulative;
A has ‘ ae.’

ODE IX.

The reeonciliation of two lovers who have quarrelled ; one is ‘ Lydia?
the other is not named. The form of the Ode is like the amoebean
eclogues of Theocritus and virgil.

We may note the dramatic propriety of the feelings throughout.

His the pride of possession, hers the pride of being first in his eyes.

His the attraction of Chloe’s accomplishments, hers the happiness of
love that is returned

His the lordly relenting that offers to cast off Chloe and open the
gate again t6 Lydia, hers (with one little womanly hit in the implied
comparison of his beauty with that of Calais) the passionate delight, for
all his fickleness and bad temper, to live and die with him.

Line 2. potior, a preferred rival, as in Epod. 15. 13.

4. Persarum rege3 2. 12. 21. A comparison of 2. 2.17 will show
that, though the ‘happiness’ of a ‘Persian king‘ is proverbial, and
Greek rather than Latin, yet Horace so completely identifies Persians
and Parthians, that he would hardly have understood his commentators

when they say that he is referring here, not to the Parthians, but to the
old Persian monarchy.

5. alia arsisti3 2. 4. 8 ⁴ arsit virgine.’

7. multi Lydia nominis, not as though literally the world knew
her name; but she felt as proud of his preference as if she had a fame
equal to that of Ilia. Ritter, identifying the lover with Horace, would
make it mean, ‘ your poems were full of Lydia, and gave her a fame as
great as Ilia’s.’ For the genitive ‘nominis’ see Madv. ξ 287.

8. Romana, the ancestress of Rome (as the mother of Romulus,
according to one form of the legend; cp. 1. 2. 17). The epithet indi-
cates the source and the extent of her fame; possibly it is further in—
tended to adapt the'comparison to the mouth of a Greek.
