PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

  
    
 
        

ἵ ΜΥ obligations to previous editors are, I hope, frankly
i stated in the course of my notes. Orelli’s edition had always
ς seeined to me so perfect in point of learning, judgrnent, and
ᾗ poetical taste‚ that when the task of preparing an English
Ι commentary on Horace was first suggested to me Ι was
¹ inclined to answer that nothing rexnained to be done, unless
t perhaps to translate his Latin notes for the benefit of the
l more indolent students. In effect, of course, this is not what
ξ has been done. If one's own judgment was to be responsible
l for the conclusions‚ there were even among recent editors
ι others whose views could not be ignored. To name only
l two, there was clearly much to be learnt from the imaginative
-1, ingenuity of Ritter, and from Dillenburger's strong sense and
j keen grammatical analysis. A wider reading of Horatian
J literature, if it made originality appear even more impossible,
l seemed at the same time to encourage or even necessitate
l independent judgment. It lessened to some extent the
feeling of personal obligation, by showing how large a
j portion of what was best in modern editors, both in respect
j of illustrative learning and of interpretation, was traditional,
l a part of the iriherited store of Horatian criticism, which
Ξ dates from the scholars of the 15th and 16th centuries, if not
i from scholiasts of a much earlier time, a store from which
later editors have made very various selections‚ but to which
ἵ none since the great Bentley seems to have made any very

Ξ considerable independent addition.
