BOOK IV.

ODE Ι.

‘Again a summons to arms, Venus! N0, spare me; it is not with me
in my tenth lustre as it was in the days of poor Cinara. Away, then,
to the house of Paulus Maximus. High-born, and handsome, and
eloquent, and accomplished, he will bear thy colours more worthily‚
and, when the victory is won, will pay thee richer honour. Ι am too
old to love, to drink, to play. Yet what am Ι saying? my heart gives
the lie to my words.’

On the meaning which this Ode acquires from its place at the begin-
ning of this Book see Introd. pp. 104-5.

Line 1. The language of this Ode answers to that of 3. 26, in which
Horace declares his love-campaigns at an end. In both places the
image is not of Venus attacking the heart of a lover, but of a warfare
carried on with her weapons and under her auspices, in which the poet
has once served, and is now called to serve again.

3. non sum qualis; cp. Epp. Ι, 1. 4 ‘Non eadem est aetas, non
mens.’ '
