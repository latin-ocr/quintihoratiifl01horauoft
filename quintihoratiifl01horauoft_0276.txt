240 HORA Tll CARMJNA.

ODE XXXII.

‘They call on us for a song. Come, my lyre, I have drawn strains
from thee before which, light though they be, will not soon die: answer ⁴
now with such music for Roman ears as thou yieldedst of old to
Alcaeus. He was a patriot and a warrior, yet amidst his wars and
shipwrecks he found time to sing of wine and love. O lyre, the delight
of gods, the solace of toil, help me too whenever Ι duly call on thee.'

It is not unlikely that the Ode refers to some request of Augustus or
Maecenas for a poem of a graver cast: Ritter thinks the six stately
Aleaic Odes which stand at the beginning of Book iii. There is an
appearance of reality in the appeal of the first stanza, and in the pains
which he takes to point out that lyrics on Lycus' black hair were not
inconsistent in Alcaeus' case with civic zeal and soldierly courage. It
is written, like Od. 1. 1, 2. 20, 3. 3ο. when Horace had become easy
as to his own powers and their recognition by the world. See, how-

ever, on v. 1.

Line 1. poscimur, so V; and it is interpreted by both the Schol., and
so quoted by Servius on Virg. Ecl. 1. 10. The reading is strongly sup-
ported by the occurrence of the same phrase several times in Ovid.
Fast. 4. 721 ‘ Palilia poscor) ‘ Ι am asked for a poem on the Palilia ’ς
Met. 5. 333 ‘Poscimur Aonides,' 4. 274 ‘Poscitur Alcathoe,’ ‘ scilicet
ut narret fabulam,’ Bentl. There is a rival reading ‘ poscimus,' which
has the authority of Β and of Diomedes, and which Bentl. supports.
It seems to necessitate the alteration, which he also adopts, in the mode
of taking the whole stanza. He puts ‘ si quid . . tecum’ into a paren-
thesis, making ‘ quod et hunc in annum vivat et plures' a description
not of what Horace and his lyre have already sung, but of the greater
song now asked for, ‘ carmen ‘ being constructed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘ pos-
cimus' and ‘die‘ It is obvious that this would alter the character of
the poem. It would hardly lead us to think of any special occasion,
and the tone of confidence would have vanished from it.

si quid . . lusimus the usual formula sor urging a petition. C. S.
37 ‘ Roma si vestrum opus est,' etc.; Virg. Aen. 4. 317 ‘ si bene quid
de te merui . . oro.’

vacui, in hour of leisure. S. 2. 3. 10 ‘si vacuum tepido cepisset
villula tecto ’; virg. G. 3. 3 ⁴ quae vacuas tenuissent carmina mentes.’

2. lusimus, παίζειν, Pind. Ol. Ι. 23; ‘si quid olim lusit Anacreon,'
Od. 4. 9. 93 ‘haec ego ludQ' S. 1. 10. 37. So Virg. E. 1. 10, G. 4.
565, of light and playful poetry; or used depreciatingly by an author of
his own persprmances, which he represents as the amusement of a
leisure hour.
