NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXXV. 249

The old mis-take of the Comm Cruq.‚ who took all the expressions of
instruments of torture, has found no recent desender except Ritter.

There is a well-known criticism on this stanza in a note (30) to
Lessing's Laocoon. It seemed to him an instance in which poetry
had suffered from inattention to the laws which distinguish its func-
tions from those of painting. It is a picture, the attributes all appeal
to the eye. ln a painting or piece of sculpture they would be all seen
at a glauce. The effort of mind required to comprehend them would
be very small 3 and in the meantime, as ‘ Necessitas ’ would be in itself
merely an unnamed female figure, they would be necessary symbols
to convey the allegory to the spectator. It is different with the poet.
The symbols are not needed to interpret the personification, sor he
can speak the terrible name of the power which he is personifying.
They need interpretation themselves, and their accumulation wearies,
because, though each costs a fresh efsort to the mind, there is no cor-
responding distinct addition to the idea eonveyed. What, when we
interpret it, is implied by the molten lead that was not also implied
by the nails'? Few will dispute the main propositions of Lessing's
criticism ; but we may notice that Horace does not leave the interpreta-
tion of the symbols to the unassisted efforts of the mind. The epithets
are an integral part of his description, and they give at every turn the
moral meaning which sculpture or painting could only indirectly convey.
As Orelli remarks, ‘ aena manu ⁷ is an addition which poetry only could
have ventured to make, for it involves a metaphor within the meta-
phor. The very sameness srom this point of view has some force.
Horace gives us a very detailed picture, but in every feature he bids
us see one and the same awsul character.

21. albo velata panno. The image seems to be taken from the
actual custom which was observed by the priests who sacrificed to Fides
of veiling their hand in a white eloth, the symbol expressing apparently
at once seeresy (contrast Od. 1. 18. 10 ⁶ Arcani Fides prodiga pellucidior
vitro ’) and guilelessness.

rara, i.e. rarely found. The epithet really reminds us that loyalty is
a quality, and so impairs the personification‚ cp. Od. 2. 16. 21.

22. comitem abnegat, ‘denies thee a companion‚’ i.e. the only com-
panion whom she could deny, viz. herself. Ovid, possibly in imitation,
⁴ Si qua repugnarat nimium comitemque negarat‘ (sc. se), A. A. 1. 127.
For the sing. verb see on Od. 1. 3. Io.

24. inimica. It can hardly be denied that some confusion in the
allegory is brought to the surface by this epithet. In this stanza at
least Fortune is not a power wholly external to the person who suffers
or rejoices, but rather the genius of his life, ‘ mortalis in unum-Quodque
caput, vultu mutabilis.’ This is quite clear from its first lines, for Hope
