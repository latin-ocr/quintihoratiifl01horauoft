3 80 ΗΘΚΛ Tll CARMJNA.

23. certo foedere ; 1. 3. 18 ‘irrupta copula.' It is one of Horace's
abl. absol. (see on 2. 1. 1 2), neither exactly the abl. of the ground of the
action with ‘ metuens ' nor the abl. of the quality with ‘ castitas ἐ it adds
a circumstance which completes and explains both substantive and par-
ticiple, ‘the marriage bond was inviolable’: ‘foedus’ of the covenant
of marriage ; cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 339 ⁸ neque haec in foedera veni.'

24. “They dare not sin, or if they sin they die‚' Conington. For the
constr. of ‘nefas . . aut’ cp. 3. 12. 1, 2. A few MSS. read ‘pretium
mori,' one ‘pretium emori? If this were adopted we might still take
it as above. Bentley, and after him several editors, make ‘ nesaS‚' etc. a
continuation of the ‘dos‚' τὸ ἀθέμιτον εἶναι, κ.τ.λ. ‘the fact that they
dare not sin‚' etc.; but the Latin is awkward.

pretium, ποινή. The word does not necessarily imply either reward
or punishment. Juv. Sat. 13. 105 ‘Ille crucem sceleris pretium tulit,
hic diadema?

25. It appears from Porph. that in his time some copies marked the
beginning of a new Ode here, for he condemns such a division. See on
Od. 1. 7. 15 and Epod. 2. 23.

26. civicam, ‘of citizens against citizens.' See on 1. 2. 21 ‘audiet
cives acuisse ferrum.’

27. Pater urbium. It is impossible to doubt that Horace had in
mind the historie title of great patriots, ‘ Pater Patriae‚’ which, though
it had not yet been conferred on Augustus by the Senate, may yet have
been currently given to him by his partisans (see on 1. 2. 5o); but the
form ‘ Pater urbium' is taken rather from the more special designations
given to their benefactors by particular towns. Orelli quotes an in-
scription to Augustus from Jadera, a colony in Illyria, IMP. CAESAR. Divi
r. AUG. PARENS commas nimum Er Tuam-:s Dnnrr. Cicero bids his brother
(ad Q. Fr. 1. 1) deserve the title of ‘ parens Asiae.’ This general bene—
factor is to be recognised as such from city to city, to have in each his
statue with the memorial of his public services.

28. subscribi, i.e. to have his name inscribed at the bottom of the
statues.

29. refrenare licentiam, cp. 4. 15. 9, where Horace proclaims that
Augustus has accomplished this task‚ ‘ ordinem Rectum evaganti frena
licentiae Iniecit.'

30. quatenus, ‘since‚' Sat. 1. 1. 64, 2. 3. 76, Juv. 12. 102; not found
before Horace.

31, 32. For the sentiment cp. 2. r. 10-14‚ and the verses attributed to
Menander: Δεινοῖ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ πάντες ἐσμὲν etan-Aee? Ζῶντι φθονῆσαι narea-
νόντα δ’ αἰνέσαι.

32. quaerimus, ποθοῦμεν, ‘requirimus,‘ ‘we look for without
finding.' ,
