17. palam captis gravis. His soemen would have been taken in
open day, in fair fight; but when taken they must not have looked sor
quarter. Perhaps the position of ‘palam,' where it answers to the
key-note of the last stanza, ‘ mentito . . falleret‚’ is meant to enable it in
thought to qualify both ‘ captis' and ‘gravis’ ‘He was open through-
out ; he resorted to no stratagem‚ and he affected no clemency.’ Some
MSS. leave a gap in the place of ‘ captis’; a few have ‘vict0r,' one

from a gloss, ‘flexus‘ The Comm. Cruq. himself had read ‘vietus‚‘ and
interprets it by · flexus.’
