NOTES. BOOK l, ODE Vll. 183

What Plancus' trouble was we do not know, nor whether it bore any
resemblance to Teucer's by involving a compulsory absence from his
well-loved Tibur.

L. Munatius Plancus was a man of no character, ‘morbo proditor‚'
Vell. Pat. 2. 83. He had been a friend of Julius Caesar; aster his
death he changed sides more than once between Antony and Octavius.
By the latter he was made consul in B.C. 4²·

With the story of Teucer at the end os the Ode compare the con-
clusion os Epod. 13. 11 ad fin.

Several of the best MSS. begin a new Ode at v. 15. The division
was as old as Porph., for he notices and condemns it; on V. 15 ‘ Hanc
Oden quidam putant aliam esse, sed eadem est; nam et hic ad Plancum
loquitur cuius in honorem et in superiore parte Tibur laudavit, Plancus
enim inde fuit oriundus.’ There seems too little substance in the first
sourteen lines sor a separate Ode, and the recurrence to Tibur in v. 20
is clearly the link, though a slight one. Mistakes in the matter are
common in the MSS. See Epod. 2. 23 and 9. 27. Porph. mentions
and condemns a division of Od. 3. 24 at v. 25, though it is not so
found in any extant MS. The opposite mistake occurs in Od. 2. 14, 15,
which are written continuously in several of the oldest MSS„ although
there is no conceivable connection between them.

M etre—-A lcmanz'um.

Line 1. laudabunt alii, ‘I shall leave it to others to praise'; see
on v. 1 of the last Ode.

claram, ‘sunny,' ‘quia soli sit opposita‚' Porph.; and so Lucan took
it, 8. 248 ‘ claramque reliquit Sole Rhodon] or ‘ glorious'3 Catull. 4.
8 ‘ nobilem Rhodum.'

5. sunt quibus, see on Od. 1. 1. 3.

6. perpetuo, a continuous poem not merely touching incidentally on
Athens, Ov. Met. Ι. 4 ‘ prima ab origine mundi In mea perpetuum
deducite tempora carmen.'

7. '¹ To wreathe their brow with the olive plucked on every hand,'
i.e. to seek fame by writing on a well-worn theme. This is Bentley‘s

interpretation. The expression contains a reminiscence of Lucret. 1.
⁸ 926 ‘iuvat . . novos decerpere flores‚1nsignemque meo capiti petere inde
coronam Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae,⁷ a passage which
Horace imitates again in Od. 1. 26. 6, 7. The ‘olive' leaf is speciali)-
named as the appropriate crown for one who wrote of Athens z Bentley
quotes Sen. Herc. F. 913 ‘ Populea nostras arbor exornet comas, Te
ramus oleae fronde gentili tegat, Theseu.’

undique, ⁶ by every one‚’ parallel to the use of ‘ unde ’ = ‘ a quo,' of
the agent, Sat. 1. 6. 1·2‚ ete. All other interpretations are more forced.
