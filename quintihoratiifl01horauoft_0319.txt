‘ impacatos Iliberos.' Notice that ¹ bellicosus ’ really applies to ⁶ Scythes ’
also, and ⁶ divisus Hadria ’ suggests a parallel ‘divisus Tyrrheno mari ²

Fas trepidat.’ Orelli quotes Plat. Phaed. 68, C τι) περὶ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας

10. rubens nibet. This phrase for the brightness of the moon, which
is not common (though Propertius uses it 1. 10. 8 ⁶ Et mediis caelo Luna

one and the same blushing face that the moon shines on us.'
