NOTES. BOOKI, ΘΟΕ ll. 167

Augustus, you must be our prince. Long may you live———stay the civil
war, and chastise the Parthians 2 ‘

This is one of the Odes which seem to challenge us by the definite-
ness of their historical allusions to find their (late, and which yet baffle
us if we attempt to do so. That the portents referred to in vv. 1-20
are those which followed the death os Julius Caesar, nc. 44 (Dio C. 45.
17‚Virg. G. 1. 466 soll„ Tib. 9., 5. 71 foll, Ov. Met. ¹5- 782 soll),
seems certain from vv, 18. 44, although Horace stands alone in men<
tioning the inundation of the Tiber, Dio and virgil only speaking of
the Po. 'l'hat the Ode was not written at that time is still more certain.
Augustus did not then occupy the whole horizon of politics. Horace
was at Athens, and on the point ofjoining the army of Brutus. Franke
places its composition in Rc. 29, when Augustus returned to Rome after
the victory of Actium, and celebrated his threefold triumph (see v. 495.
Dio (53. 4) makes Augustus assert that his mission had been τῷ πατρὶ
δεινῶς σφαγέντι τιμωρῆσαι as well as τὴν πόλιν ἐκ μεγάλων καὶ ἐπαλ-
λήλων κακῶν ἐξελέσθαι. And the temple of Mars Ultor, of which the
facade probably still stands, in the sorum of Augustus, was built in
fulfilnient of a vow made by him, ‘bello Philippensi pro ultione
paterna susceptos Suet. Octav. 29; cp. Ov. Fast. 5. 569. If Horace
identifies sor a moment the ‘ scelus expianclum’ with the death of
Caesar, his thoughts at least are not running on any cruel vengeance
when he sees in the avenger the incarnation of ‘gentle Maia's son,’ the
god of peaceful arts, of prudence and persuasion‚ of commerce and
wealth.

Compare with the whole poem Virg. G. 1 466 to the end—a com-
plete parallel both in sentiment and expression.

Line 1. terris misit. A common poetical dative, Od. 1. 12. 59
‘ mittes fulmina lucis ;' Virg. Aen. 2. 398 ‘demittimus Orco.'

djrae. A word properly of augural signification, ‘ of bad omen,'
‘ diri cometae,' Virg. G. 1. 488 3 ‘ dirae aves‚' Tac. Ann. 12. 43. Dillen-
bui-ger points out that, though put only with the last of the two subst.
after Horace‘s manner, it qualifies both. He gives the following list of
instanoes, Od. 1. 31. 16, 1. 34. 8, 2. 8. 3, 2.19.24,3.2.16, 3.11. 39,
