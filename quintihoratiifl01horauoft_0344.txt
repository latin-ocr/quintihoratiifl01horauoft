ιι. truncis cavis. The resemblance to the passage just quoted
from Eur. Bacch. makes it very probable that ‘trunci’ is used here
os the hollow thyrsus, If it is of the trunks of trees, compare the
⁴ golden age in Virg. E. 4. 50, when ‘durae quercus sudabunt roscida
mella.’

13. beatae, predicative. The song,r is to be ofAriadne's apotheosis, .

as well as of the transformation of her crown into a star.

14- honorem, her ornament, her crown, the ‘ Gnosia ardentis stella
coronae,' Virg. G. 1. 222. See the story in Ov. Met. 8.' 176. For
the use of ‘ honos’ cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 814 ‘ regius ostro Velet honos
humeros.'

tecta. Penthei, Eur. Bacch. 633 δώματ’ ἔῤῥηξεν χαμᾶζε συντεθρά·
νωται δ’ ἅπαν.

16. Lycurgi, Hom. Il. 6. 130 foll„ Soph. Ant. 955.

17. This refers to his conquest of India. The powers of nature ait'ed
him in the enterprise; the Orontes and Hydaspes turned their streams
at the touch of his thyrsus that he might cross them, and the sea grew
calm before him. Nonnus Dionysiaca 13. 123.

flectis can only be used of ⁵ mare ’ by a zeugma.

barbarum, sc. ‘ Rubrum vel Indicum!

18. separatis, as ‘ 1·emotis,’ v. 1.

uvidus, opposed to ¹ siccus‚' 4. 5. 39; βεβρεγμένος, μέθῃ βρεχθείς,
Eur. El. 326.

20. Bistonidum. The Bistones (fem. Bistonis, plur. Bistonides)
were a tribe of Thrace, a chief home of the Dionysiae cultus. Bacchus
is represented as twisting vipers in their hair without injury to himself
or them (⁴ sine fraude? cp. Carm. S. 41). Cp. Eur. Bacch. 101 foll.

23. Rhoetum, 3. 4. 55. Nauck thinks that Rhoetus owes his
selection to the assenance ‘ Rhoetum retorsisti?

leonis, actually in the form of a lion. See Hom. Hymn. 6. 44, Eur.
Bacch. 1019 φάνηθι . . πυρφλέγων ὁρᾶσθαι λέων. ¹

25. quamquam, qualifyiug what precedes, ‘ and yet.' ⁵ Sed ' is again
adversative to this concession.

28. mediusque. The ‘que ’ misplaced, as in v. 323 see on 1. 30. 6.
It is a question whether ‘ wem ⁷ or ‘medius' is the main predicate. In
the former case the verse will mean, ⁴ Thou wast the same (i e. equally
vigorous and successful) in the midst of peace and in the midst of war.’
Iu the latter we must interpret with Orelli, ‘medius’=‘m3dway between
peace and war‚' meaning ‘equally adapted for peace and war.' No real
parallel has been quoted for the expressiom the sense is the same as
Virgil's ‘pacisque bonas bellique ministras} Aen. 11. 658, quoted by
Orelli. ,

29. insonS, without attempting to harm you.
