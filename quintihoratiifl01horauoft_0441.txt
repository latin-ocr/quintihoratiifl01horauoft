NOTES. BOOKJV, ODE Π. 405

30. plurimum, probably with ‘ laborem‚' and with a slight relation
of antithesis, as its position shows, to ‘grata' Dillr„ after Bentley,
joins ⁴ plurimum nemus’; but the epithet would not be very forcible
(Bentley wished to escape srorn it to ‘floreum')‚ and ‘nemus ripasque
uvidi Tiburis ' is a thoroughly Horatian arrangement.

uvidi; 1. 7. 14, 3. 29. 6.

31. operosa parvus . . fingo, probably not without some reference
back to the first description of I'indar's poetry, its vast spontaneous rush,
‘immensus ruit profundo ore.’

33. concines. We should rather expect an emphatic ‘tu.’ Cp. 2.
17. 30, 3. 17. 5. The ‘ ego . . parvus’ of the last stanzas contrasts not
only with Pindar before. but with Antonius ⁵ maiore plectr0,' who sol-
lows. We may note, also, that part of the contrast lies in the occasion.
⁴ Not now, neither you nor Ι. By and by, whenever it is that Caesar
comes home in triumph, a greater poet than 1 shall sing his praises, and
even I (v. 45) shall find a voice in my delight? ‘Maiore plectro'
occupies a double relation, as instrumental ablative with ‘ concines,’ and
descriptive ablative with ‘ poeta ’ ; see on 1. 3. 6. With the expression
itself cp. ‘leviore plectro‚’ 2. 1. 40, ‘aureo plectro‚' 2. 13. 26.

34. quandoque:‘quandocunque'; see 4. 1. 17, A. P. 359.

35. per sacrum olivum; see on Epod. 7. 7 ‘ Britannus . . descend-
eret sacra catenatus via.' Cp. Mart. 1. 71. 5. The name was given
to the slope by which the ‘sacra via' descended, from the spot where
its pavement is still visible under the Arch os Titus, into the Forum,
a fall of 53 feet. Bum’s Rome and Campagna, p. 78.

36. Sygambros ; see Introd. to the Book, p. 259.

37. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 17 (of Augustus) ‘ Nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale
fatentes?

42. publicum ludum. The technical and usual phrase would be
‘ludos,’ but Horace varies it slightly, after his custom3 2. 4. 24, 3. 5.
42, 4.14.1‚4.15.9.

super impetrato . . reditu, in discharge of the vows for his return,
which have won their' purpose. Orelli mentions the fact that coins
have been found of the year B.C. 16 (A.U.C. 738) with the inscription
S.P.Q.R.V.S. (vota suscepta) PRO s. (salute) ΕΤ RED. Auo. The ‘ludi
votivi' here anticipated were really celebrated in nc. 133 Dio C. 54. 27.

45. audiendum, ‘that merits hearing.’ Horace is speaking, at the
moment, not of shouting with the shouting mob, but of singing, i,e.
writing poetry; but there is probably a metaphorical play in the expres-
sion, ‘ if Ι can make my voice heard in the din.'

46. bona pars; Sat. 1. 1. 61, A. P. 2973 so ‘bona copia,' Epp.
Ι. 18. 109. ‘A large part,' i.e. I will raise my voice ungrudg-

in gly-
