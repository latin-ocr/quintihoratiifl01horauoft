222 HORATII CARMINA.

perpetuus, broken by no waking‚ ἀτέρμονα νήγρετον ὕπνον, Mosch.
3. 110. Catull. 5. 5 ‘ Soles occidere et redire possunt: Nobis quum
semel occidit brevis lux Nox est perpetua una dormienda.'

6. urget, ‘lies heavy on’; Od. 4. 9. 27 ⁶ Urgentur . . longa nocte'3
Virg. Aen. 10. 745 ‘ Olli dura quies oculos et ferreus urget Somnus.'

Pudor, αἰδώς. According to the definition in A. Gell. 19. 6‘ t'imor
iustae reprehensionis,’ the sensitiveness to the judgment of others,
which makes a man modest, harmless, temperate

7. Fides, defined by Cic. Off. 1. ‘dictorum conventorumque con-
stantia et 'feritas' and called there ‘ iustitiae fundamentum.' In calling
Good Faith or Honour the sister of Justice‚ Horace implies that the
two go together, and therefore that both were present in Quintilius.

nuda Veritas, as Aer. explainS, ‘quae nihil occulti habeat ut egeat
tegumento.' Ritter compares the picture of Quintilius, the candid
critic of A. P. 438 foll.; see Introduction to this Ode.

8. inveniet, for the sing. verb after several subjects, see Od. 1. 3. 5.

11. frustra pius. VirgiL the gentle and reverent poet, has com-x
mitted his friend to the sase keeping of the gods, little dreaming how
they would discharge the trust; now he asks back his ⁶ depositum’
(cp. Od. 1. 3. 5—8) only to find how fruitless his piety has been.
Another interpretation is that of Lambinus, ‘ Thou askest Quintilius of
the gods, and findest, despite thy piety‚ that he was not lent to thee on
such terms,' i. e. that you should never part. The first is probably
right as assigning the same agent to ‘ creditum' and ‘ poscis,’ and as
giving a more definite sense and connection with the context to ‘ frustra
pius.’ With the thought of these words we may perhaps compare, as
a characteristic difference between the two poets, Virgil's notice of the

same moral difficulty, Aen. 2. 426*430‚ and his more reverent and
religious comment. ‘ Dis aliter visum.’

, ita =⁴ hae conditione‚' on such terms as this.

13—15. quid si . . num. The words ‘ frustra pius' have struck the
note which is the key to this stanza. ‘ In vain—did 1 say?—while he
was alive. What if you had the persuasive lyre of Orpheus? could it
restore to us the dead? Orelli reads ‘ Quod si . . non,’ but against
the preponderance of MSS. For the construction, a hypothetical
question preceded by the interrogative or exclamatory ‘quid‚’ Dinr.
refers to S. 2. 5. 159, Epp. I. 19. 10, Virg. Aen. 4. 311.

15. vanae imagim'. Cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 292 ‘ tenues sine corpore
vitas . . volitare cava sub imagine sormae.' The unsubstantial forms.
νεκύων εἴδωλα, in Hom. Od. 11, have to drink a clraught of blood before
they can recover life enough to talk with Ulysses.

17. lenis recludere, App. 2, ξ 2.

precibus, the dat.= ‘ in answer to?
