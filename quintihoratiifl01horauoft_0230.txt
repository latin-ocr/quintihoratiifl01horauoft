1 94 HORA Tll CARMJNA.

Regifugium that Horace is recalling. It suggests the leap across Roman
history to the death of Cato of Utica, the latest, as that was the earliest
instance of devotion ⁵ pulchra pro libertate.⁷ Bentley, in his wish to
bind Horace to a chronological order which in such cases he never
follows, would rob him of the credit of this tribute to a lost cause (see
on Od. 2. 7) by reading cx mera conj. ‘ anne Curti.’

37. Regulum, see on Od. 3. 5.

Scauros. The reference, as in Juvenal's catalogue of the stern Censors
of old days, ΙΙ. 90 ‘Quum tremerent Fabios durumque Catonem Et
Scauros et Fabricios,’ is to M. Aemilius Scaurus, Cos. Rc. 115 and 107.
As censor in ac. 109, he constructed the Aemilian Road. Cicero is
never tired of extolling him, see esp. pro Font. 7 and pro Mur. 7. The
plural need mean no more than ⁵ such people as Scaurus,' as in Virgil’s
·Extulit haec DeciOS, Marios, magnosque Camillos‚’ G. 2. 169, and
juvenilis ⁴ Fabricios,’ l. c. Cp. the long list, including ⁴ Fabricios’ and
⁴ Aemilios? in Cic. pro Sest. 68.

38. Paulum, L. Aemilius Paulus the Consul who refused to leave
the fatal field of Cannae, Liv. 22. 38 foll.

40. Fabricium, C. Fabricius Luscinus, Cos. 13.C. 282 and 278 ; ⁴ parvo

potentem Fabricium,’ Virg. Aen. 6. 844. The story of his refusal to
avail himself of treachery against Pyrrhus is told by Cicero, Off. 3. 22;
>tories of his contented poverty by Val. Max. 4. 3. 6; cp. Cic. Tusc.
3· 23-
41—44. ⁸ He and Curius of hair unkempt were bred to do good service
in war, and Camillus too, by stern poverty and the ancestral sarm with
its cottage home to match.’ They were ⁴ rusticorum mascula militum
l'roles‚' Od. 3. 2. 37.

41. incomptis, cp. Od. ε, 15. 11 ‘intonsi Catonis,‘ of Cato the
Censor. Pliny (N. H. 7. 59) says that the first ‘tonsor' was brought
ιο Rome from Sicily in Bc. 500, and that Scipio Africanus was the first
Roman who was shaved daily. To have lived before the days of barbers
implies antiquity‚ and the absence of soster modern habits.

Curium, M. Curius Dentatus, who as Consul won the battle os Bene-
ventum, ΒΩ. 275. He is a standing example of ancient Roman sim-
plicity. ‘Qui Curios simulam& Juv. 2. 3; cp. id. 11. 78 foll. Cicero,
Sen. 16, numbers him among the worthies who ‘a villa in senatum
arcessebantur.’

45. ‘As a tree grows by the unmarked lapse 'of time, so grows the
glory of Marcellus’; so the glory of the house, ,dating at least from
the captor of Syracuse (ac. 212), is now culminating in the young

Marcellus
occulto, as Lucret„ of the wearing away of iron by infinitesimal de-

crementS, ‘ occulte decrescit vomerin arvis,' Ι, 315.
