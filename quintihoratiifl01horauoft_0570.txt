“Haflng examined the Oxronn Brenn Fon TEACHERS carefully, I am
greatly plcased with it. The ‘Helps to the Study of the Bible' at. the

-end contain a grean amount of most valuahle insormation, well calculated

not only to lead to a good understanding of the text, but to stimulate
the student, to further efforts. It differs from many publications in this,
that. the informe-tion is so admirably arranged, that it. is well suited for
reference, and is easily available for the student. The edition would be
most useful to Sunalayschool Teaehers‚ a great help to those who desire

that, the young shall have a real knowledge of the Word of God.”—Tm=
Bienor> or CORK.

“The Oxronn Brenn ron Tmcurms may, Ι think, without exaggeration, be
described aas a wonderful edition of the Holy Scriptures. The clearness and
beauty of the type, and the convenient shape of the volume, leave nothing
to ln: desit-ecl. Ι know nothing of the same compass which can be compared
to the ‘Hclps to the Study of the Bible’ for sulness of information and
general accur-acy of treatment. lt is only real learning which can accom-
plish suc'u a seat of compression.’‘-Tfln Bienor> οε Dniznv ΑΜ) RAPnon.
