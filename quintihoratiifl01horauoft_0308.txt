272 HORATH CARMJNA.

as the common friend of the poet and the emperor in Augustus’ letter
preserved in the Suetonian life of Horace.

This is vone of the Odes which is assigned by several of Horace's
chronologists to a date earlier than EC. 31 (see Introd. to Books i—iii‚
ξ 2). We must not, perhaps, iay very much stress on the fact that the
year 29 is the earliest time at which we know of public attention being ’
called to the difficulty of subduing the Cantabri (ν. 2) ; but the positive
arguments for the early date seem slight. If the words ‘lasso maris et
viarum militiaeque' arc to be pressed (see note on v. 1), they would
carry the Ode back not only beyond 31, but to a time when Horace
was really fresh from his campaign, and before he could well have
become familiar with Tibur and Tarentum. Macleane justly remarks
that the tone of the Ode is not that osa young adventurer freshly come
to Rome to begin life. Nor is the argument stronger from the sup-
posed incompatibility of his roving tastes with his possession of the
⁴ unica Sabina,⁷ which he obtained in Bc. 34. Cp. his language in
Ep. 1. 7. 44 ⁶ mihi non tam regia Roma Quam vacuum Tibur placet aut
imbelle Tarentum.'

Line 1. Gades aditure. The beginning of the Ode is taken from
Catullus, 1 1. 1, ‘Furi et Aureli comites Catulli, sive in extremos penetrabit
Indos: etc. Here this proverbial test of friendship is more specially in
point. ‘You are such a fast friend that you would go to the furthest and
most dangerous places with me, much more will you come to Tibur or
Tarentum.' Dillf. points out that the three places named represent
distance (ί remotis Gadibus,' 2. 2. 10) and danger, either of war or ship-
wreck. We may notice, perhaps, that they correspond also, though
not in the same order, to the three things of which the poet professes to
have had enough, ‘maris, viarum, militiae.' This softens the difficulty
of which Orelli complains, that Horace should speak of himself in
mature life as weary of toils which he had long left behind him. The
whole line of thought has been ruled by his imitation of Catullus.
·You would go with mc anywhere, but d0n⁷t let us put our friendship
to such a test, we have had enough in our time of wanderings and
fighting, we are growing old, let us go to Tibur, or to Tarentum.'

3. barbaras Syrtes. The coast is given a bad name not only for
its dangers (see on Od. 1. 22. 6, where there is the same conjuncfion),
but for the savageness of its inhabitants. Virg. Aen. 4. 41 ‘inhospita
Syrtis.'

5. Argeo, Ἀργείῳ, as ‘Lesbous' instead of the Latin form ‘ Lesbius,'
Od. 1. 1. 34. For the historical reference see on Od. 1. 7. 13.

ῖ. maris et viarum, Epp. 1. 11. 6 ‘odio maris atque viarum’3 so
⁴ viator’ is opposed to ‘navita,' Od. 3. 4. 32. The genitive seems to go,
