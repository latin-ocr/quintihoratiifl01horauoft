NOTES. BOOKJJJ, ODE XVI. 363

see it, who glitters in the lordship of fertile Africa.’ This seems to be
a hyperbolical way of describing a man who owns wide com-lands in
Africa, as another is said in v. 41 to ‘join in one sweep the kingdom of
Alyattes to the broad plains of Phrygia.⁷ Cp. 2. 2. 10—12 ⁵ si Libyam
remotis Gadibus iungas et uterque Poenus Serviat uni,' and read with
this the note there. Ritter takes ‘fertilis Africae’ with ‘ sorte‚' com-
paring ‘Sors Asiae’=‘ the proeonsulship of Asia‚’ Tac. Ann. 3. 58 and
71, ‘is a happiness beyond the proconsulship of rich Africa, though he
cannot see it who is in the dazzling light of power ’ (‘fulgentem verum
latere facilius potest quod dignitatis splendor oculos praestrinxit '). But
in this rendering, if stress is to be laid on the glory of power, we lose
the force of the epithet ‘ fertilis-⁷ and of the direct comparison with the
poet's few aeres and certain crops. Is we emphasize ⁶ fertilis,' as im-
plying that the proconsul of Africa has the opportunity of enriching
himself, ‘fulgentem imperio’ loses much of its meaning. The metaphors
grow to a great extent out of the context. ‘ Fulgentem imperio ’ is an
echo of ‘ dominus splendidior': ‘regnum Alyattei‚' ete„ as an exemplifi- .
cation of ‘vectigalia porrigam' is suggested by the proverbial wealth
of Croesus.

This interpretation is amply proved by Horace's use of ‘vectigalia’ in
Sat. 2. 2. 100, and the current Stoie aphorism (Cic. de Rep. 4. 7, Parad.
6. 3) ⁶ magnum vectigal parsimonia? For ‘porrigere’ ε ‘to extend,' cp.

unusual name. ‘ Halyatti,‘ ‘halyathii‚’ ‘ halialyti‚’ ‘ aliat thii‚’ ete.
