‘venis omnibus acta sitis.' So the meaning is, ‘no pouring into the
veins will cure the thirst3 there is something that must be got rid os out
of them—some inner malady in the recesses os the body.'

15. aquosus languor, ‘the saintness caused by the water.’

17. redditum cyri solio, cp. 3. 29. 27 ‘regnata Cyro Bactra? It
is the most distinct enunciation of that identity of the Parthian with
the Persian monarchy which Horace assumes elsewhere. See on Od.
1. 2. 22. For the historical event referred to see Introd. to Books
i-iii‚ ξ 8.

19. Virtus, the judgment os a virtuous man, as in Sat. 1. 3. 42.

20. dedocet, ‘ would sain unteach the people to use names salsely.'

ODE III.

‘Let the thought of death moderate both repining in trouble and
exultation in prosperity. Enjoy yourself while you may, for death is
at hand, sor rich aud noble as well as sor poor and humbly born.'

Some little doubt hangs over the name of the person to whom these
counsels of Epicureanism are addressed, The old Blandinian MS. gave
it as ¹ Gellius.⁷ Cruquius identifies him with L. Gellius Publicola, the
brother (half brother through their mother Polla, or brother by adop-
tion, according to different theories) of Messalla (Od. 3. 21. 7), and
consul nc. 36.

Dellius (as the other good MSS. and the MSS. of Aer. and Porph.
write the name) would probably be Q. Dellius, who had changed sides
so often that Messalla is said to have nicknamed him ‘Desultor bel-
lorum civilium.' He had deserted successively Dolabella. Cassius, and
finally Antony on the eve of the battle of Actium. Gellius' character
was not such that Horace would gain much by the substitution of his
name for that of Dellius.

Line 1. aequam . .arduis. There is probably some slight feeling
of the verbal antithesis, ‘when life's path is steep (ἀναντὴς) let your
mind at least be ou a level.’

3. insolenti, not that all joy is ‘insolens ’ :——‘ chastened from insolent
excess of happiness,' from the ὕβρις, of which κόρος in the Greek tra-
gedians was the parent.

5. seu, seu, depend on ‘morituref ‘ sor that thou must soon die.
whether thy life has been sad or merry.’ With the emphatic position of
‘moriture’ cp. Od. 1. 28. 6.
