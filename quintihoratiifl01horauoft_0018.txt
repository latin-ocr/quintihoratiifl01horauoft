Lastly, we have numerous quotations‚ chiefly in the grammatical

authors of the first five centuries. These are rarely of any very ·

high value3 partly because quotations seem often to be made
from mernory, partly because the quotation is most commonly
made for some metrical or grammatica] reason which is not
affected by the special word or form in respect of which the
doubt exists‚ and therefore the testimony to the reading is not

in truth older than the MSS. (not usually very ancient) of the ’

grammatica] author himself.

So far, then, as externa} testimony goes, it is clear that when 7
a disputed reading occurs, the evidence to which we can appeal =
to determine it contains in every department some elements of 1>
uncertainty, and is not likely to be rated at the same relative ’
value by all critiCS. Can the MSS. be made. by any process of =
comparison, to testify, through common readings, to sources of }

evidence older than themselves, older even than the Scholia?

Has the value of any special MS. been unduly estimated ? Is a η

particular Scholium genuine, or is it an interpolation to suita
late MS. reading Ρ There will remain these and other previous
questions upon which perfect agreement cannot always be
obtained3 and, in default of such agreement, an editor or a
reader who approaches questions of text on this side, con-
fessedly with only second-hand knowledge, can hardly form his
judgments too modestly. It must not be supposed, however,
that the criticism of H orace⁷s text, any more than the criticism of
other classical texts, turns by any means entirely upon the
testimony of MSS. or Scholia. However far these carry us

back, they leave us, on the one hand, with the certainty that ς

varieties of reading existed, and that emendation on gram-
matical or other grounds had been at work, still earlier; and,

on the other hand, they leave, if not very many blots which χ

modern criticism has unanimously recognised and corrected,

yet enough of these1 to make us feel that when the question '

of the MSS. The mistakes in proper names are notorious; e.g. the ’ 1
Scholiasts, by their quotation from Homer, show that they had the right ³
