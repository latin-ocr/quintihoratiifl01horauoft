NOTES. BOOK l, ODE XXXVII. 255

uses of the imperfect there is always reference to some past thought,
though the relation of the thought to the leading statement may vary.
(1) ‘It is, all the time, though we (lid not think so.' This is the Greek
use of ἄρ’ ἣν. πόθος καὶ κακῶν ἄρ’ ἧν τις, Soph. O. C. 1697; so Od.
1. 27. 19 ‘quanta laborabas Charybdi'3 so also negatively A. Ρ. 19
⁸ sed non nune erat his locus.’ (2) ⁶ It is as we thought truly‚' as here.
(3) ‘So we thought, but experience shows it is not so’: this is the
use in the passages of Ovid osten quoted to illustrate this place: Trist.
4. 8. 5 ‘ Nunc erat ut posito deberem fine laborum Vivere ⁷; and ib. 24
‘Me quoque donari iam rude tempus erat.⁷ This, again, is like the
Greek use of ἐβουλόμην, ἐχρῆν, of impossible wishes, and duties that
will not be fulfilled. It should be said that the imperfect has been
taken here in a simpler sense by Orelli, as rebuking the tardiness of the
preparations, ‘dudum oportebat’3 ὥρα δ’ ἧν πάλαι, Arist. Eccl. 877.
This, however, weakens the antithesis, ‘nunc . . . antehac.⁷ Ritter and
Dillr. take it still more simply, but less forcibly, as contrasting the
public ‘supplicatio' which has already begun, and which he approveS,
with the private festivities‚ ‘nunc cst bibendum,' which he enjoins.

5. antehae, a dissyllable, as ‘anteit‚‘ Od. 1. 35. 37.

Caecubum, 1. 20. 93 Epod. 9. 1 ‘repostum Caecubum in festas
dapes?

6. cellis avitis, the bins which oui· grandsires filled; so it is the
oldest as well as the choicest wine reserved for such an occasion.

Capitolio, the symbol of Rome's eternal empire‚ ‘ Capitoli immobile
saxum.' Cp. Od. 3. 3. 42, 3. 5. 12.

7. regina. The title ‘Regina' would be doubly odious to Roman
ears. Cp. Od. 3. 5. 9 ‘ sub rege Medo,⁷ and Epod. 9. 12 ‘emancipatus
feminae? Orelli notes that coins of Cleopatra's have been found with
the inscription ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΑ ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ, and coins of Antony's with
the inscription ¹ Cleopatrae Reginae Regum Filiorum Regum?

dementes ruinaS, the epithet transferred from the person to her
purpose. Cp. Ι. 3. 40 ‘iracunda fulmina.⁷

8. funuS, so Cic. Prov. Cons. 19. 45 ‘casum illum meum sunus esse
reipublicae?

imperio, see on 1. 2. 26.

9. turpium morbo=‘qui turpi morbo illicitarum libidinum labora-
bant.’ Orelli.

10. virorum, κατ’ ezpcavaav=‘eunuchorum? Cp. Epod. 9. 13.

quidlibet impotens sperare, App. 2, ς 2, with no sels-restraint in
the audacity of her dreaming; ‘impotens ⁷ is a translation of ἀκράτης.

ζ 12. ebria, ‘ drunken with the sweet draught of fortune.’ Dem. Phil.
1. p. 54 οἶμαι ἐκεῖνον μεθύειν τῷ μεγέθει τῶν πεπραγμένων.
13. vix una sospes. For the construction cp. 2. 4. 10 ‘ademptus
