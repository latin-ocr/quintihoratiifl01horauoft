have arisen from a desire to make the construction of the two clauses
more symmetrical; ‘sepulchrum condere bello' in the sense of ‘finem
facere bello‚' is hardly an Horatian metaphor; and, as Bentley remarks,
‘Africano' is not a distinctive epithct enough for the war, we need
‘Punico’ The Jugurthinc war was equally in Africa. The Scholiasts
interpret ⁶ super‚’ ⁴ over againsl,' and have a mythical story osan oracle
desiring Scipio's bones to be removed from the Vatican hill (they
would have been in the toml) of the Scipios on the Via Appia, not on
the Vatican) to a tomb at Ostia, ⁶ over against Carthage.’

27. punico. a less usual form of ‘puniceo’ Either scarlet or white
was the proper colour of the ⁵ Imludame11tun1‚' or general's cloak.

28. sagum was the eloak of the common soldier on service, opp. to
⁶ toga,' the dress of a citizen; as understood with ‘punico' it loses its
special sense. For the construction of ‘mutavit’ with the accusative

33. capaciores, cp. Od. 2. 7. 21- 23.

‘Propempticon inimico poetae.’ Contrast it with the beginning of
Od. I. 3. Very little is known of Maevius beyond the fact of his being
the special enemy of Virgil as well as of Horace. ‘ Qui Bavium non
odit amet tua carmina, Maevi,' Ecl. 3. 90. The few doubtful stories
connected with him will be found in Smith’s Diet. Biog. under the
name of Bavius.

‘Bad luck go with the ship that bears Maevius. May each wind
play its part in wrecking it. May never a star show itself. Be the sea
