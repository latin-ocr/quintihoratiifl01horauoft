1 98 HORA TII CARMINA.

On our view there will be nothing to fix it to a definite date. The
ship is in sight of harbour. This distinguishes the Ode from Epodes vii.
and xvi. (sce the Introductions to them). 1t is not yet moored beyond
the reach of the wind. So long as the most timid politician could see
in any movement a thought of renewed resistance to the rule which had
saved Rome from anarchy, so long might Horace have vented his fears,
or appealed to the sears of others by this allegory.

A plausible suggestion of Torrentius, which Franke adopts, finds an
occasion sor the Ode in Bc. 29, when Augustus, according to the state-
ment both of Suetonius (Oct. 28) and of Dio Cassius (52. 1), entertained
the thought of abandoning the supreme power which had just fully come
into his hands. Dio gives a speech of Maecenas on that occasion, in
which he uses the very allegory of the Ode. As Macleane remarks, this
may prove too much. It is as certain as can be that Horace drew his
image not from any speech of Maecenas, but from Alcaeus. Maecenas or
Dio may more probably have taken theirs from Horace.

The image of a ship for the State is an old one. See, inter alia, Aesch.
Sept. c. T. 1, Soph. O. T. 25, Plat. Resp. p. 488, Theognis, 671-682.

Line 1. referent . . . novi, a double statement. Fresh waves are rising,
and they will carry thee back. Horace speaks of the civil war under
the same metaphor in Od. 2. 7. 15 ‘Te rursus in bellum resorbens Unda
fretis tulit aestuosis? aud in Epp. 2. 2. 47 ‘ Civilis . . belli . . aestus';
although in those cases it is iudividuals, not the State, who are battling
with the waves.

2. fortiter occupa portum, ‘make a brave effort and gain the
harbour first‚' i. e. before the fresh waves prevent you. The ship is still
outside the bar.

4. nudum, supply ² sit,’ as also aster ‘ saucius) Orelli speaks of this
as ⁶ miro zeugmate ex v. ‘⁵ gemant ’' v. ‘⁶ sit ’‘ elicere,’ and thinks it far
more poetical to make ‘gemant ’ the verb to all three clauses. But it is
a harsher zeugma to speak of a broadside swept bare of rowers as
‘ groaning' in the same sense as yardarms. And if ⁶ gemant' apply to all
three subja-ets, the ‘antennae ’ are lest without any special description of
the injury done to them. Bentley, accepting the reading of some of the
less ancient MSS„ ‘gemunff ‘ possunt‚⁷ puts the question at ‘ latus:
making the second stanza consist of categorical statements. For ‘ vides
ut . . gemant,’ the particular sense of ‘ seeing’ being lost after a time
in the more general nction of‘ perceiving‚‘ cp. Od. 3. 10. 5-8 ‘ Audis quo
strepitu ianua . . remugiat Ventis, et positas ut glaciet nives Iuppiter‚'
and Virg. Aen. 4. 490 ⁴ mugire videbis Sub pedibus terram et descendere
montibus ornos.'
