NOTES. BOOK ll, ODE XV. 293

os the genitive with verbs of estimating, and significs the equivalent at
which the crime is assessed.

20. Sisyphus, Hom. Od. 11. 593.

21. Compare Lueret. 3. 907 soll. ‘Nam iam non domus accipiet te
laeta, neque uxor Optima‚' etc.

23. cupressos, ‘ funebres,’ Epod. 5. 18; ‘ferales‚’ Virg. Aen. 6. 216.
They are used in the latter passage to ornament in some way the funeral
pile. Orelli quotes Ovid, Met. 10. 141, where Apollo says to Cypa—
rissus just changed into the tree that was to bear his name, ‘ Lugebere
nobis, Lugebisque alios aderisque dolentibus?

24. brevem, as ‘ brevis rosa,' 2. 3. 13, ‘master on a short tenure‚’
cp. Epp. 2. 2. 172.

25. Caecuba, 1. 20. 9. The plural is of quantity, cp. 2. 1. 5.

dignior, worthier, apparently, because he makes a wiser use of it;
but there is a certain bitterness in the epithet. Cp. Sat. 2. 3. 122
‘ Filius aut etiam libertus ut ebibat heres . . . . custodis)

⁴ 27. tinget pavimentum, Cic. Phil. 2. 41, os the spilt wine os a
profuse and drunken banquet, ‘ Natabant pavimenta vino, madebant
parietes.'

superbo, ‘lordly.’ ‘Pro “ipse superbus ”3 Hypallage figura‚’ Acr. '
Horace makes it the epithet of ‘ mero,' as though the wine itself showed
lordliness—‘ generosus—at once in its quality and in allowing itself to
be so squandered. The asyndeton, ‘superbo . . potiore,’ indicates, as
Orelli says, that the second epithet justifies the first.

28. Od. 1. 37. 2 ‘Saliaribus dapibus’3 Mart. 12. 48. 2 ‘ Non Albana
mihi sit comissatio tanti, Non Capitolinae Pontificumque dapes.’

ODE XV.

‘ Our palaces and fish-ponds and ornamental gardens are supplanting
‘the cultivation of corn and vines and olives. This is not the spirit of
our sires. Their rule was private thrift, public magnificenee; houscs of
turs, public buildings and temples of hewn stone!

The Ode is in the same vein as the six Odes at the beginning of
Book iii. especially the 6th‚ and belongs probably to the time (B.c. 28)
when Augustus, having accepted the censorial power, set himself to
the work of religious restoration and social legislat'10n3 see Merivale,
ch. 33.

Compare with the Ode the letter of Tiberius to the Senate in Tac.
Ann. 3. 53 soll„ esp. such sentences as ‘Quod primum prohibere et
priscum ad morem recidere aggrediar? villarumne infinita spatia?
familiarum numerum et nationes? argenti et auri pondus? . ..At
