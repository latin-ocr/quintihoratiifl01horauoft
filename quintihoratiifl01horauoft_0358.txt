29. ductum, as ‘trahere bellum,’ Sall. Jug. 643 ‘prolonged by our
quarrels‚' ‘ seditio ' in the sense of στάσις.

30. protinus, ‘this moment, and from hencesorth?

3¹- nepotem, Romulus is the grandson of Juno as the son of Mars;
his birth is a fresh grievance besides the ‘graves irae’ against his Trojan
ancestry.

32· Juno will not name Rea Silvia ; see on vv. 19, 20. There is
probably additional scorn in the close conjunction of ‘ peperit’—
‘ sacerdos’ (=‘ a vestal: as in Virg. Aen. 1. 273 ‘ regina sacerdos Marte
gravis ³), and in the epithet ⁴ Troica,’ as if it meant not merely ‘of Trojan
blood: but ‘ a true Trojan.’

33. Marti occupies the place of emphasis as stating in one word the
consideration which induces her to forego the resentment which had
such sul] grounds. Compare the balancing of the sentence in 2. 8. 1—5
with note. ’

redonabo, a word only found in Horace, Od. 2. 7. 3. It is here used
in the same sense as ⁴ condonare’ in Caesar, Bell Gall. 1. 21 ‘ Dumnori-
gem Divitiaeo fratri se condonare dicit,’ i.e. Dumnorigi ignoscere
propter fratrem.

illum ego, both emphatic. It would not be strange that any other
of the gods should consent to the admission of Romulus, nor that Juno
should consent to the admission of any but one of that hateful parentage.

is as old as the Pseudo-Aer. and Porph, the former of whom interprets
⁴ propinare-potare.' the latter ‘ assuescere saporibus nectaris.' A slight
preponderance of MSS. is in favour of ‘discere,' B omitting the Ode,
and no testimony existing to the reading of V. ‘ Ducere ' is the simpler;
it is a common Horatian word, as with ⁸ pocula,’ Od. 1. 17. 22,
‘ Liberum: 4. 12. 14, etc.

35. adscribi ordinibus, ⁴ adscribere civitati,’ Cic. pro Arch., ⁴ urbanae
militiae,¹ Tac. Hist. 2. 94. It may be doubted how far any distinct
metaphor is felt in ⁶ ordinibus,' whether a muster-roll, or the seats of
the Council—hall.

quietis a touch of the Epicurean doctrine of Sat. 1. 5. 101 ; cp. ‘ea
cura quietos sollicitat‚' Virg. Aen. 4. 379. ⁷

37. longuS, saeviat, imply that the sea which flows between them
must be ‘dissociabilis'

38. exsules, the banished Trojans, and provided they do not break
their banishment. ⁶ Dictum sane videtur cum leni quadam despicientia‚'
Orell. The emphasis is really on the one thing that she cares for, viz.
that Troy and Troy's manners should have an end. This is brought out
equally by the half contemptuous way in which she speaks of the fate
os the ⁴ exiles* in comparison with that of their old home, and by the
