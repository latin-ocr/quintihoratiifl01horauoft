viii PREFACE TO THE

Perhaps the department in which modern editors have
added most, as it is the one which has had the most attrac- 9
tions to me, has been that of tracing in the several poems ¹
the sequence and proportion of the thoughts. This is a =
function of criticism to which every reader with any imagin-
ation thinks himself equam and he is apt to resent what
seem to him the superfluous, if not prosaic and inadequate,
comments of another mind. A commentator on a poet so
loved and familiar as Horace is, at any rate to the elder
generation among us, must make his count for such resent-
ment. He would only attempt in part to disarm it, by
pleading that as he has ventured at times to set aside the
interpretations of his predecessors‚ so he is quite prepared
that his own interpretations should be set aside by others; t
that it is the purpose and the method, not the particular con· 1
clusions, to which he attaches value.. The thoughts even of
a lyrical poem do not follow one another at haphazard. If
the links be forged by feeling rather than by logie, yet the
feelings must be such as can be traced, and the mind cannot
be really in sympathy with the poem unless consciously :
or unconsciously it follows them. Where the art is so ἒ
conscious and elaborate as in Horace’s lyrics, it is not too
much to expect that we should be able to detect the threads
which bind them into their several unities. If my efforts
teach a young reader that he has not read a poem properly ζ
unless he has attempted to do this for himself, if they make
him less ready to admit in any poet, and especially in Horace, η
the existence of ‘ inert' epithets. and purposeless digressions
or amplifications, I shall not complain that he should come
to trust for the explanation of his difficulties to his own
imagination rather than to mine.

Some account of the materials at our disposal for the
settlement of the text of Horace, and of the principles on
