24· vicina, ‘ our neighbour.’ Others take it as ‘his neighbour, who
will not listen to his passion ’; and Orelli quotes Bosscha, as suggesting
that the person meant is the Rhode of the next lines, ‘ She doesn't care
sor Lycus, but she will soon be herc to look for Telephus.’

24-26. Dillr. remarks how the repetition os ‘ Lycus ⁷ and of ‘ te' serves
the purpose of emphasizing them, the one by way of scorn, the other of
compliment.

26. pure, as ‘sole puro,y 3. 29. 45, shining in a clear sky. Cp. 3, 9.
21 ·sidere pulchrior?

27. tempestiva, suited in point of age.

28. lentum 1. 13. 8.

ODE XX.

‘Beware, Pyrrhus; you are robbing a lioness of her cubs. She will
come to reclaim Nearchus, and you must expect a battle royal; and all
the time Nearchus doesn't care sor you or sor her.'

Line 2. Gaetulae; see on 1. ²3- 10.

3. post pau110=‘ paullo post’ even in prose. Diur. points out the
antithetical arrangement of the words ‘ dura . . inaudax‚‘ ‘inaudax
raptor': the last has the force of an oxymoron. ‘Inaudax‘ is an in-
vention of Horace from the Gr. ἄτολμος.

6. insignem, easily found among them all.

7. grande certamen. We need not understand ‘est ⁷ or ‘erit '3 it is
rather a cognate accusative characterising the aetion os the last sentence
by giving its result, a construction common enough in Greek. Dillr.
collects some other instances of it in Latin : Sat. Ι. 4. 110, Epp. 1. 18.
49, Virg. Aen. 6. 223 <where see Conington's note), 8. 683.

praeda . . maior, not ‘who should win more of the prey‚' sor the
prey was one; but ‘who should rather win the p1·ey.' Cp. Epod. 5. 29.
It is a not uncommon confusion of language; see Madv. ξ 300 c, with
soot note. We may compare the use of ‘multus’ sor ‘multum’ (Sat.
1. 7. 28 ‘multo fluenti'), and such expressions as Virg. Aen. 1. 181
⁴ Anthea si quem laetatum pelago videat '= ‘ if he could see anything os
Antheus' There is no need at all to accept, with Orelli, Peerlkamp's
prosaic alteration ‘ tibi praeda cedat, Maior an illa,' ‘ whether the prey
shall fall to you, or she prove the stronger.'

11. posuisse, with a present force, ‘to have placed‚' and so ‘to be
keeping ’ there. See Conington's notes on Virg. G. 1. 25, Aen. 2. 257.

1 2. palmam, the palm of victory sor which they are contending. The
attitude at once displays his foot and expresses his lordly indifference to
