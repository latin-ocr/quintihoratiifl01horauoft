12 immetata, ἅπαξ λεγ. The abs enee of divisions of property is
a characteristic of the golden age in Virg. G. 1. 126⁶ Ne signare quidem
aut partiri limite campos Fas erat.' The conjunction of ‘immetata'
with ‘iugera,' which is a measure os sursace, has the effect of an oxy-
moron.

13. Fruges et Cererem, ἓν διὰ δυοῖν, probably like ‘gemmas et
lapides‚’ v. 48; the double substantive is meant to express universality,
⁶ fruits of the ground of every kind.'

14-16. This is best illustrated by Caesar’s description (B. G. 4. Ι) os
the Suevi, from whom it is possible that Horace has transferred it to
the Scythians. ‘Suevi centum pagos habere dicuntur, ex quibus quo-
tannis singula milia armatorum bellandi causa ex finibus educunt. Re-
liqui qui domi manserint se atque illos alunt. Hi rursus invicem anno
post in armis sunt, illi domi remanent. Sic neque agricultura nec ra-
tio atque usus belli intermittitur. Sed privati ac separati agri apud eos
nihil est; neque longius anno remanere uno in loco incolendi causa
licet.'

14. nee cultura placet, etc., seems therefore possibly to include the
two ideas that no individual was employed in tillage for more than a
year together, and that the same piece of ground was not tilled for more
than a year. ‘ None cares to till the soil sor more than a single year,
and when one has fulfilled his toil a successor relieves him on the same
terms of service.’

16. aequali sorte, sc. for a year's turn.

vicarius, as Cicero calls Murena, the consul elect, ‘ vicarium diligen-
tiae meae,' Mur. 37.

17, 18. ⁶ Holds her hands from harming her motherless step-children.’
For the use of ‘temperat’ cp. Cic. Verr. 3. 59 ‘Te putet quisquam
sociis temperasse ⁷¹? Ritter takes it, aster the Schol., as=‘ pocula tem-
perat,’ ‘innocens ' implying that she mixes no poison in the cup. There
is no authority for the absolute use of ‘temperare ' in this sense.

19. dotata, on the strength of her dower. Plaut. Men. 5. 2. 16 ‘Ita
istaec solent quae viros subservire sibi postulant dote fretae seroceS.’ Id.
Aulul. 3. 5. 61 ‘ Nam quae indotata est ea in potestate est viri ; dotatae
mactant et malo et damno viros.' It is constr. with ‘regit,‘ but not
with ‘fidit’; cp. 2.5.13, 3. 23.14.

regit, fidit, the point is the inversion of lawful relations.

21. ‘The ample dower they bring is their parents' worth‚¹ the pure
blood and healthy traditions of virtuous households. Contrast 3. 6.
17 soll.

22. metuens alterius viri3 the gen. as ‘rixarum metuens‚’ 3. 19.
