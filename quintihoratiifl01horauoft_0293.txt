the grounds os the foregoing statementS, the infinitive following ‘fortis,'
as in 1.1.18‚ ete.

iacentem, metaphorical=‘afflictam ac desolatam,' Orelli. Bentley,
at the suggestion of one MS, would read ‘tacentexn.'

26. asperas, 1. 23. 9.

28. combiberet, ‘drink the full draught.’ The story of her death
by the bite of an asp was, according to Dio (51. 14), due to conjecture.
Some κεντήματα λεπτὰ were found on her arm, which were attributed
by some to the bite of an asp, by some to a poisoned needle. Suetonius
also (Aug. 17) only says ‘ putabatur.’

²9· deliberata, in the sense of Cicero’s ‘ certe statuere ac deliberare?
Verr. 2. 1. 1.

30. Liburnis, dative. Their will, which she grudged thern, is ex-
pressed in the infinitive clause. For the Liburnian galleys see on
Epod. 1. 1.

31. privata, ‘ unqueened.’ The nominative is after the Greek idiom.
Porph. and Aer. quote Livy for the statement that Cleopatra ⁴ cum de
industria ab Augusto in captivitate indulgentius tractaretur identidem
dicere solitam fuisse οὐ θριαμβεύσομαι.’

ODE XXXVIII.

A slight Ode, expressive of the modest avoidance of pomp and luxury
which Horace professes and recommends.

Orelli sees, and doubtless rightly, a meaning in its position at the
end of the book, and immediately after the spirited Ode on Cleopatra's
death. Cp. the position of Od. 3. 7, and see Introduction to Odes 1-111,
ξ 11. 3, and notes on 2. 1. 37, 3. 3. 69, 3. 5. 55.

Line 1. Persicos, of oriental luxury. Ritter quotes Tac. Ann. 2. 57
⁶ Vox‘quoque eius [sc. Pisonis] audita est in convivio, cum apud regem
Nabataeorum coronae aureae magno pondere Caesari et Agrippinae,
leves Pisoni et ceteris offerrentur principis Romani non Parthi regis filio
eas epulas dari ; abiecitque simul coronam et multa in luxum addidit?

2. nexae philyra. φιλύρα was the Greek name of the lime tree,
Lat. ‘tilia'; but it is used in Latin for the fibrous inner bark of that
tree (Herod. 4. 67), which was employed, amongst other purposes, in
making garlands (Plin. N. H. 16. 25. 14). Ovid calls such garlands
‘sutiles,’ Fast. 5. 335.

3. quo. Mr. Shilleto (on Thuc. Ι. 89) explains this as an instance of
attraction and absorption of the antecedent, ‘ quo ' =⁶ eo ubi‚' comparing
Ter. Adelph. 2. Ι. 36 ‘illuc redi quo occepisti? It is perhaps better to
take ‘sectari’ as only a picturesque substitute for ‘quaerere' and ad-
