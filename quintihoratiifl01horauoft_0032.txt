The editions os the Scholia of which I have made use are
those of F. Hauthal (Berlin, 1864) and F. Pauly (Prague,
1858)

I have also referred often to Estre⁷s ‘Prosopographeia Hora· J
tiana' (Amsterdam, 1846) and Franke’s ‘Fasti Horatiani'
(Berlin, 1839).

Ι should not forget the translations of Horace's Odes by

Conington, Lord Lytt0n‚ and F. W. Newman, to each of which 1

I have been at times indebted for a happy rendering or an in-
genious suggestion.

Horatius, Od. 4. 6. 44, Epp. 1. 14. 5.
Flaccus, Sat. 2. 1. 18, Epod. 15. 12.

[Of the origin of the ‘cognomen' nothing can be guessed.

The ‘nomen ’ might imply that his father, on manumission, had ”
taken a gentile name from some member of the Horatia gens. ζ]
It is now more generally believed, on a suggestion of G. F. ¹⁵,
Grotefend, that it was derived from the Horatia tribus, the one ⁴
of the country tribes in which the colony of Venusia was en· Ἴ
rolled, and to which Horace’s father, as a libertus of Venusia, ‘J‘

would belong]
