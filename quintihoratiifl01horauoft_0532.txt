4 9 6 ON THE UNKNO WN NA MES

Odes (the names of Horace's rivals, as in 1. 13, on any theory
of a real Lydia) are Greek names, Telephus, Gyges, Calais;
mythological names3 sometimes the names of Greek rivers,
Hebrus 3. 12, Enipeus 3. 7. Vt'e may add perhaps that where
the designation is most full and precise we seem to see most
definitely the purpose of giving momentary substance to an
acknowledged shadow 3 see on ‘Thurini Calais filius Ornyti' 3.
9. 14, and cp. Introd. to 2. 4. ln a few cases we seem to see
the appropriation of the name to a special character, as ‘Cyrus‚²
1. 17. 25, 1. 33. 63 ‘Pholoe‚' 1. 33. 7, 9, 2. 5. 17, 3.15.7; ‘Tele-
phus,' 1. 131, 3. 19. 26, 4. 11. 213 ‘Lyce,‘' 3. 10, and 4. 133 but
this last instance (viewed in the light of the general relation of
Book iv. to the earlier Books) points to the explanation that it
is in all cases a literary identity, a reminiscence of a previous

poem, not of a living person. On the other hand, the same ¹
name is at times given to people of such different characters
or ages, that those who would give them real existence are
obliged to recognise more than one owner of the name ; cp. the
Phyllis of 2. 4 and 4. 11, the Chloris of 2. 5 and 3. 15, the Lalage
of 1. 22 and 2. 5, not to say the Glycera of Ι. 30 and 1. 33.
There are cases, doubtless, where a reality is given to unknown
names by their being brought into close relation with real
persons and events, such as ‘Mystes,' the lost friend of Valgius,
in 2. 9 ; ‘Damalisj who is to rival Bassus in draughts oswine
at the feast on Numida’s return, 1. 363 ‘Glycera,' to whom
Tibullus is supposed to write piteous elegies, Ι. 33. In this last
case we note that Glycera is not a name that occurs in Tibullus'
extant elegies, which suggests the possibility that even in such
instances as these, though the reference be real, the name may
be fictitious. This is of course the ultimate refuge of those who
would see in the heroines of the Odes real persons. The names
they give up ; but Horace, it is argued, may have concealed
the true names, as tradition tells us (see 2. 12 Introd.) Catullus
concealed the name of Clodia under that of Lesbia, Propertius
that of Hostia under that of Cynthia, Tibullus that of Plania
under that of Delia, etc. ; and Horace himself, in the Epodes
and Satires, the name of Gratidia under that of Canidia3 it is
