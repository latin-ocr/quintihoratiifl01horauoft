with this one exception, it stands absolutely alone) by a Gotha ,
MS. of the 15th century, known as g. That it was not free 1
from interpolation, especially in the Odes, is allowed by those ζ
who rate it most highly3 see e-g. Od. 4. 2. 6, where it reads Ῐ
‘ cum . . saliere,⁷ 4. 6. 21 ‘flexus’ In such a case as that ,
noticed in Sat. Ι. 6. 126, there seem only three theories 5
possible; unless, with Ritter, we can suppose that we have
actually a δευτέρα φροντίς of the poet, we must imagine a blotted ⁸
half-line deliberately filled up either in V (or its original), or in
some one archetype to which all the other MSS„ and the copies
which were interpreted in the Scholia, owe their reading.

2. The oldest Bcrnese MS. ¹ (363 in the Public Library) was
first used by Orelli in forming his text, and has since been re· Ἴ
collated by Ritter for his edition, and by Usener for Keller and ¹
Holder. lt is assigned by Ritter and by Usener to the 9th 3
century. It forms part of a quarto volume, which contains also 1
Servius’ Commentary on VirgiL two Treatises on Rhetoric‚ ¹
Bede's History, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses. It is imperfect,
omitting all the Epistles and Satires, with the exception of the
tirst two and part of the third of Book Ι, besides large portions
of the Odes The Odes are not arranged in their usual order,
the copyist having apparently started with the intention of an ’
arrangement according to metres, for he begins with nineteen ¹
Sapphic Odes. These follow the common order, though the
distinction of Books is not marked. They are succeeded by

¹ An interesting account of the history of this and of several other of
the older MSS. of Horace is given by Ritter in the Prolegomena to his
edition. This MS. was originally in the Abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire‚
at Fleury near Orleans. then the abbey was sack-ed by the Protestan‘ts
in the Civil War in 1562, the MSS„ in which it was rich, were saved, ,
and found a home iu the library of Pierre Daniel, an ‘avocat' and '
literary man of Orleans, and ‘bailli' os the abbey. At his death his
books were divided between two friends and fellow-townsmen‚ Paul μ’ ¹
Petau and Jaques Bongars. The latter of the two died at Paris in 1612, 1
and left his library. including his share of the Fleury MSS„ to Rene de Α ¹
Graviset, a jeweller of Strasburg. De Graviset migrated subsequently
to Switzerland, and his son became a leading citizen of Bern, founded a
public library there and placed in it his books, amongst them this MS.
