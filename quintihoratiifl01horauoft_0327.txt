NOTES. BOOKII, ODE XIV. 291

usual ‘decipere laborem’ (Sat. 2. 2. 12 ‘ studio fallente laborem') into
the passive, either retaining its accusative, as in such phrases as ‘sus-
pensi tabulam loculosque lacerto‚’ or taking instead of it the Greek
genitive of relation.

39. Orion. Τὸν δὲ μετ’ Ὠρίωνα πελώριον εἰσενόησα Θῆρας ὁμοῦ
εἰλεῦντα κατ’ ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα, Hom. Od. 11. 571. Orion, like Sap-
pho and Alcaeus, is engaged in the same pursuits as in life. Virg. Aen.
6. 654 ‘ suit vivis quae cura . . eadem sequitur tellure repostos.'

‘lyncas' as masc.; Virg. G. 3. 264 makes it fem. ‘lynces Bacchi

ODE XIV.

‘ The years are flying, Postumus; no prayers will stay them; not
three hecatombs a day will turn the heart of Pluto the tearless‚ the
almighty, who holds Geryon fast, despite his three bodies, and Tityos,
behind the Styx, aye, the Styx, which we must all cross alike, rich and
poor. You may avoid all common risks, yet you must die. The
treasures that you have boarded your wiser heir will squander.'

The burden is the same as that of Od. 2. 3 and 11, and of 4. 7 ‘Life
is short, let us enjoy it while we may’; but there is more of sadness in
this Ode than in the others. The usual moral is hinted in the passing
epithet ‘dignior’ bestowed on the heir who is to waste our store of
choice wine; but the feeling of the stanza is not so much for his wisdom
as for the additional bitterness which it adds to our labours to know
that they may be all undone as soon as we are dead. ‘ We must leave
it unto a man that shall be after us, and who knoweth whether he shall
be a wise man or a f001?’ Eccles. 2. 19. There is no clue to the
person addressed. It has been suggested that he may be the Postumus
to whom Propertius writes his Elegy (3. 12).

Line 1. fugaces labuntur. We must not try to harmonize the meta-
phor, although both ‘fugax’(Od. 2. 3. 12) and ¹ labi’ (Epp. 1. 2. 43)are
used of running water :——‘ the fleeting years slide by.’ words are
accumulated which convey the idea of rapid and continuous motion,
but the mind does not dwell on the form long enough to gain a distinct
picture of the metaphor by which in each case the idea is conveyed
to it.

2. pietas, Od. 4. 7. 24. Cp. Ov. Am. 3. 9. 37 ⁴ Vive pius, moriere
pius; cole sacra, colentem Mors gravis a templis in cava busta trahet.'
⁴ Pietas ‘ is exemplified in the next stanza.

3, 4. instanti, indomitae, the epithets which signify the nearness
