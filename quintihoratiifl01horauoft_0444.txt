ODE III.

‘The poet is one set apart from his birth by the Muse's favour;
neither his mode of lise nor his objects of ambition are the same as
other men’s. For llzcm are the training and the prizes of Greeian games
—the life of a soldier and the triumph on the Capitol; for lzz'm the
woods and waters of Tibur and the glory of song. 1, too, am a poet.
Ixome the mistress os the world aeknowledges me as such, and the
voice of envy is still. It is thy gift, O Muse; both the inspiration and
the popular acknowledgment of it.’

Compare with the Ode 1.1 u hen he looks to Maecenas’ taste to give
him the rank which here he assumes as given him by the voice of Rome.
There are many parallelisms of thought and expression between the two
Odes; there is the same division of the objects of Greek and Roman
ambition (‘ sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum’), the same descrip-
tion os the poet's lise (v. 30 ‘ me gelidum nemus‚' eto), and of his hope
to be ranked with the Greek lyrists (cp. ‘Lesboum . . barbiton‚’ ‘lyricis
vatibus inseris,' with ‘inter amabiles vatum ponere me choros,' ‘Ro-
manae fidicen lyrae ').

it in Silv. 4. 4. 31 ‘ Elei labores.>

4. clarabit, a rare and arehaic word, not found elsewhere in this
sense of ‘ make famous.'

5. ducet, not in the race, but rather (with ‘victorem ⁹) in the
triumphal procession The double picture is completed in Horace's
wza) the chariot of the lxoman‘ impelator‘ must be borrowed fiom the
Greeian victor, the olive w reath of the latter from the bay crown of the
sonner.

thaieo seems not to be opposed to ‘Isthmius' (as though it could
signify distinctively ⁶ Olympian '), but to the Roman triumphal chariot
described in the following lines. Virgil and Horace (Od 1. 15. 35) use
the word, like the Homeric Ἀχαιοί, generally of the Greeks before
Troy; and this would nearly coincide with its prose meaning in their
time, as the province of Achaia included all southern Greece.
