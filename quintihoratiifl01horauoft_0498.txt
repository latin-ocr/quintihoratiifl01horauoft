462 HORATJI EPODON LIBER.

42. pernicis = ⁴ strenui'; ‘impiger Apulus‚' Od. 3- 16. 26. The
whole passage is imitated by Statius, Silv. 5. 1. 122 soll.

Apuli, see on Od. 1. 22. 13 and 3. 5. 9.

43. exstruat, a natural asyndeton, which Lambinus and others need-
lessly fill up by reading ‘ sacrum et ’ or ⁶ sacrumque.’

44. sub adventum, ‘as her husband's return draws near?

45. laetum, as Virgil's ‘ laeta a1·menta‚' ‘ healthy,' ⁶ fruitful.’

47. horna, of the simplicity of his rustic fare, ‘ wine of the year,' and
so drunk, as we should say, ‘ from the wood ’ ; never drawn off from the
· dolium ' into ¹ amphorae ' or ‘ cadi’ for storing.

48. dapes inemptas, Virg. G. 4. 132.

49-60. Compare Sat. 2. 2, where a ‘pernix Apulus' discourses in
favour os plain living: most of the dainties named here occur there
also.

49. Lucrina, from the Lucrine lake3 Sat. 2. 4. 32 ‘Lucrina peloris?

50. scari, Sat 2. 2. 22.

51. intonata, of the noise of the wind. Macleane compares Virg. G.
1. 371 ‘Eurique Zephyrique tonat domus.' The deponent form is not
found elsewhere.

53. Afra avis, Juv. 11. 142. Martial 3. 58. 15 calls apparently the
same birds ‘ Numidicae guttatae.’ They are commonly identified with
our guinea-fowl. μ

54. attagen, Mart. 13. 61 ‘ Inter sapores fertur alitum primus Ioni—
carum gustus attagenarum.' It is said to be the heathcock.

56. oliva . . lapathj . . malvae, cp. Od. 1. 31. 15, 16 ‘ Me pascunt
olivae, Me cichorea levesque malvae,' where ⁴ leves' answers to ‘gravi
salubres corpori.' ⁴ Lapathum ' is our sorrel.

59. His vegetable diet is varied with meat on rare occasions, on the
festival of Terminus (Feb. 25, cp. Ov. Fast. 2. 639 foll.), or when a kid
has been torn by a wolf but snatched from his mouth. Cp. Martial's
Coenula (10. 48. 14) ‘ haedus inhumani raptus ab ore lupi: and
Plutarch's saying (Sympos. 2. 9), τὰ λυκόβρωτα πρόβατα τὸ κρέας
’γλυκὺτατον παρέχειν, which sounds like our ‘the nearer the bone‚' etc.,
a half-humorous excuse for thrift. '

65. ditis examen domus, i.e. the proof of rustic opulence, Tib. 2. 1.
23 ‘Turbaque vernarum saturi bona signa coloni.’ Cp. Martial's de-
scription of Faustinus’ villa, 3. 58. 22 ‘Cingunt serenum lactei focum
vernae Et larga festos lucet ad Lares silva? The ‘focus' is in the
middle os the ‘ atrium,’ the images of the Lares near it, glowing
brightly with the blaze, and the slaves, all born on the estate, are
gathered round it.

69. redegit. Bentley shows by a large collection of instances,
chiefly from Cicero, that this was the usual word for calling in money
