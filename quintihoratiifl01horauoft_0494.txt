458 HORATII EPODON LIBER.

‘ Non opimae Sardiniae segetes feraces Non aestuosae grata Calabriae, γ
Armenta.’ Cp. Epp. 2. 2. 177, in a similar connection, ‘Calabris ¹

Saltibus adiecti Lucani.’
26. nitantur, ‘ struggle ’ ; ⁴ aratris nisus poetice tribuitur qui proprie
boum est‚’ Orelli.

mea. The best MSS. have ‘meis‚’ but the copyists seem to have ι

got into confusion between the terminations of 26, 28, and 303 ⁶ pascua'

dividing the older MSS. pretty equally with ‘ pascui5.’ Sound and the ζ

balance of the adjective between ‘iuvencis' and ‘aratra' are in favour
of the nominative, which is given by Orelli, Dilir„ and Munro.

27. Orelli quotes Varro R. R. 2. 1. 16 ‘ greges ovium longe abiguntur κ

ex Apulia in Samnium aestivatum‚' and ib. 2. 2. 9 ‘mihisgreges in
Apulia hibernabant qui in Reatinis montibus aestivabant.’ For the
construction of ⁶ mutet ’ see Od. Ι. 17. 2.

29. ‘Nor that Ι may have a country house on the outskirts of Tus-

Alban hills above the modern Frascati.

33. Chremes, apparently a miser of eomedy, like the Euclio of the ¹

Aulularia, but the play or author is not known.

34. discinctus, The word is used literally or with no sense further ’

than ⁵ at one's ease‚' in Sat. 2. 1. 73. It has got here, and in later
author& the sense of careless, loose, profligate—partly through the
association of this mode of dress with idle and luxurious habits, partly
through the metaphorical colour borrowed from the already established
use of ‘dissolutus’ The MSS. are divided between ‘nepos’ and ‘ut
nepos.’ Ritter thinks the repetition of the ‘ ut ⁷ forcible‚ quoting Epod.

EPODE ΙΙ.

Horace gives a point to his praises of country life by putting them
into the mouth of a money-lender notorious for his keenness in his
trade. Cp. the saying attributed apparently to the same person, the
‘ fenerator Alf1us‚' by Columella (1. 7), ⁶ vel optima nomina non appel-
lando fieri mala,’ ‘that the best debtors become bad ones if you let
them alone? There does not seem to be any attempt to make the
usurer speak in character through the poem; the pleasures named are
those which any Roman poet would have named, cp. Virg. G. 2. 493·
