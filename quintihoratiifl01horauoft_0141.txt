ODES, BOOK IV. 105

but the prelude here is more elaborate, and the irony is more
conscious. He has been asked to take up his lyre again to
sing the glory of the emperor and his step-sons, and he begins
as usual with ‘denial vain and coy excuse! ‘ He will take his
lyre‚ indeed, but it is at Venus' bidding‚ to renew under her
compulsion the bitter-sweet themes which he hoped he had
laid aside.' Ode 2 is to the same purport, though it carries us
a little further by the end. ‘He is no swan of Pindaric song,
such as is needed for 50 high a task. Some greater poet,
Antonius himself, may sing of Augustus returning in triumph
with the Sygambri at his chariot wheels, and of the people's
joy. It may be, in the rapture of that happy day, even he too
may find a voice and sing his best, and shout with the shouting
people⁷ and make his humble offerings.' And yet—the tone

³ triumphs and blessings of the empire which seems to wake

him to any of 1115 old Iyric fire, the consciousness of 1115 own
poetic power, and the immortality which he can confer on
others as he has secured it for himselfl. Odes 6, 8, 9, like
Ode 3, while they express Horace's inmost feelings, lead also
directly to the main purpose of the Book. In his own words
he gives Augustus the panegyric for which he had asked‚ and
‘pretium dicit muneri) They are divided by Ode 7, which
enforces the lesson that no other immortality must be looked
for3 high blood, eloquence, piety‚ are alike powerless to save
from the ending of all mortality—a handful of dust and a
shadow, They are followed by the Ode to Ligurinus‚ a forced

attaches to this metaphorical ‘immortality‚' the only immortality ap-
parently in which he believed. Cp. Od. 2. 20, 3. 30. 6s011. and see
