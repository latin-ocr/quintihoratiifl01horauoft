NOTES. BOOK ll, ODE IX. 279

referred to and quoted by Servius on Virg. E. 7. 22, and Aen. 11. 457.
The scattered and doubtful hints which can be gleaned about him will
be found in the Dict. Biog. He stands in Sat. 1. 10. 82 with Varius,
Maecenas,Virgil, and the other select few for whose literary approbation
Horace cares. The Scholiasts speak of him as a ‘Consularis,' and the
name occurs in the Consular Fasti, ns.. 1 2.

The date of the Ode has been a subject of controversy. Vv. 19, 20
can hardly be unconnected with Virgil's lines, G. 3. 30 foll. :—

‘Addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten,
Fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis,
Et duo rapta manu diverso ex hoste tropaea,
Bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentes.'

In both cases one set of interpreters see a reference to the year ac. 20,
when Augustus was himself in Asia, and Tiberius, under his orders, v
advanced into Armenia, and replaced Tigranes on the throne of that
country, and alarmed Phraates into restoring the prisoners and standards
taken at Charrae. It is impossible, however, in these poetical references
to Augustus' exploits to disentangle anticipation from history or the
hyperbolical dress of historical fact. Horace's language will be suffi-
ciently accounted for by Virgil's, so that, if with Hejme we think it
unnecessary to imagine that virgil inserted the lines in question ten years
after the composition of the Georgics and in the year before his death,
we shall think it equally unnecessary to set aside‚ for the sake of this
Ode, Franke's judgment‚ that the three Books were complete in ΒΩ. 23.
See Introd. to Books i—iii, ξ 2.

Line 1. hispidos predicative: of the roughened and tangled look
of the country after rains, opp. to Virgil's ‘ nitentia culta.'

3. ina-equales, ‘gusty‚' or, perhaps, ‘roughening'; cp. ‘inaequalis
tonsor,' Epp. 1. 1. 94.

5. stat, we should rather say ‘lies,‘ ‘ stands stiff and deep.'

iners, Ι. 22. 17 ‘pigris campis.’

7. Gargani, a rocky promontory at the north-east corner of Apulia.
Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 202 ‘ Garganum mugire putes nemus.'

9. tu semper. The absence of any adversative particle to mark the
antithesis is supplied by the emphatic use of the pronoun and the repeti-
tion of ‘semper' from v. 1, see on 4. 4. 17. Notice also the emphatic
position of ‘ semper‚’ v. 1, ‘usque,' v. 4, ‘ semper,‘ v. 17.

urges, Prop. 4. 11. 1 ‘Desine‚ Paulle, meum lacrymis urgere sepul-
chrum? ‘ Urgere ’ adds to some simple metaphor, such as ‘prosequi‚'
the idea of perseverance.

1 1. surgente, used inaccurately of the stars coming into sight at night,
as in Virg. Aen. 4. 352 ‘quoties astra ignea surgunt.'
