lt employs three kinds of verses 1—-
α. Ξ-ψ-- Ι -υυ-υΞ
β. Ξ-υ---υ-Ξ
γ· -ψυ-υυ-υ-Ξ-

α being repeated twice.

It is obvious that we have here variations of two movements ;
verse β repeats and amplifies the movement of the first half of
a, verse γ repeats the dactylic movement of the second half,
putting the trochees after instead of before it. This considera-
tion proves that although to the ear the movement ofB and of
the first half of a is iambic, it was in idea a sequence of trochees
preceded by an unemphatic syllable or ‘ anacrusis.’ The
anacrusis is as often short as long in the fragments of Alcaeus
and Sappho. In Horace it is occasionally short, but more l
rarely in β than in a, and never in either in Book iv. 1‘
Alcaeus had admitted a spondee in the place of the second i
trochee. Horace made the spondee imperative, see on Od. 3.
5.17‚ 3.23. 18. i
The division of the two halves of the line is marked by Δ
a caesura, which is only violated twice, in Od. 1. 37. 14 ‘ Men· i
temque lymphatam Mareotico‚⁷ and 4. 14. 17 ‘ Spectandus
in certamine ‘Martio' There are two other instances where ἦ
a preposition at the beginning of a composite word gives ἱ
a quasi-caesura, 1. 16. 21 ‘ Hostile aratrum exercitus insolens,'
1. 37. 5 ‘Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum.' Horace seems
to have paid great attention to the rhythm of verse β, excluding‚
and more carefully in his later poemS, all conjunctions of words
