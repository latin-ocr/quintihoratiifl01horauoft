4 54 ΗΘΚΛ ΤΠ CARMEN SECULARE.

nihil horum‚' with an accusative of the prayer. There is another
reading of less authority, ‘quique‚' with ‘imperet‚’ ‘may he rule'
(absol.), in v. 51.

bobus albis. The modal ablative would suit ‘veneror ’ in its usual
sense of ⁵ to do homage [θ’ (cp. e. g. Virg. Aen. 5. 745), better than in
its new sense of ‘ to pray? For the occasion of the sacrifice see Introd.

50. sanguis; Od. 2. 20. 6, 3. 27. 65, 4. 2.14.

51. bellante prior. This is part of the prayer, a picture of what
Augustus desires to be, the picture drawn by Anchises in Virg. Aen. 6.
8 52 '‘ Parcere subiectis et debellare superbos?

54. Medus. This is aster the restoration of the standards in 13.c. ²03
cp. Od. 4. 5. 6, 4. 14. 42, Epp. 1. 18. 56.

Albanas secure& the fasces, the emblem of Roman rule. ¹ Alban'
because of the connection of the origin of Rome with Alba. It is not
quite the same as Virgil's ‘Albanique patres² Aen. 1. 7; see Conington
in loc.

55. responsa. This would be the usual word for any reply given to
an embassy sent with a request or reference, as in Liv. 9. 38 ‘ sine re-
sponso legatos dimisit) Standing here alone, without mention of the

‘legati‚' it is meant probably to draw a more poetical colour from its ν J

use of the answers of gods, macies, etc.; cp. Virg. E. 1. 45 ‘ Hic mihi
responsum primus dedit ille petenti.’ For the saet see on Od. 4. 14. 42.
The visit of the Scythiam and Indian ambassadors took place while
Augustus was wintering in Samos, aster Tiberius' progress in Armenia in
13.c. 20. Some stories are told of the Indian embassage by Dio 54. 9.

60. cornu; see on Od. 1. 17. 16.

65. si, with the indicative apodosis (see on v. 68), must=‘ if, as
doubtless he doeS.'

aras. This was the reading of V, and was found by Porph., who
interprets ‘ si acceptas aras habet quae in Palatio dedicatae sunt.’ It ’is
given by Keller and ΜΓ. Mumo. B supports the vulg. ⁵ arces’; see on-
Od. 2. 6. 22.

66. felix, better taken with ⁶ Latium,’ as Dillr. and Rstter, than with

‘lustrum,' as Orelli. 1t is not Rome and Latium that Apollo will ¹
prolong, but ⁵ the state and power of Rome and the happiness of Latium.’ s

1t is still very likely that, as Orelli suggests, Horace remembered the
conjunction of the words in Ennius' verses, ‘Audire est operae pretium,

procedere recte Qui rem Romanam Latiumque augescere voltis ’; but ³
even there ‘ Latiumque ’ is in its own clause, and not a bald addition to ἶ

‘ rem Romanam.’
67. lustr-unm Od. 2. 4. 23. The period is named here clearly as the*

time for which nominally Augustus has re-aecepted the ‘ Imperium' ς ,

see Introd.
