NOTES. BOOKJ, ODE XXIII. 219

elsewhere in Horace, but not uncornmon in Ovid; cp. ‘ Ambracias
terra‚’ Her. 13. 164, etc.. though more usually with Greek names and
in an adjective. The MSS. vary between ‘ Daunias ³ and ¹ Daunia,' the
latter altered, metri gratia, in a few to ‘ Daunia in.’ For Apulian
wolves, cp. Od. 1. 33. 7.

15. Iubae tellus. Augustus restored to the younger Juba, in nc.
30, the kingdom of Numidia, which had been forfeited by his father,
the elder Juba, who fought at Thapsus on the side of Scipio and
Cato, and slew himself after their defeat. In B.C. 25 Juba surrendered
Numidia, which became a Roman province, and received instead of it
Mauretania with some tribes of the Gaetuli to the south of it. As
⁴ Gaetulus' is a common epithet of lions (see on the next Ode, v. 10), it
has been supposed that this is a passing allusion to this exchange, and
that ⁵ Juba's new territory⁷ gives a date to the Ode.

17—24. ⁵ Plaee me in the frigid zone or in the torrid (cp. Od. 3. 3. 55
‘ Qua parte debacchentur ignes, Qua nebulae pluviique rores ⁷) I care
not, Ι shall still be safe, still light-hearted.'

17. pigris, ἀργοῖς, of the dull deadness of winter; ‘ bruma iners‚'
Od. 4. 7. 12; Lucret. 5. 745 ‘ Bruma nives affert pigrumque rigorem.’

nulla arbor recreatur, i. e. there is no tree to be woke to life again
by the breezes of summer, the ‘ genitabilis aura Favoni.'

19. malus Iuppiter, see on Od. Ι. 1. 25.

22. domibus negata, unfit for human habitation, opp. to the tem·
perate zones, which are ‘mortalibus aegris Munere concessae divom‚’
Virg. G. 1. 237.

23. dulce ridentem, from Sappho's ἁδὺ φωνείσας . . καὶ γελαῖσας
ἱμερόεν. Catullus, in his imitation of that Ode (51. 5), has ‘ Dulce
ridentem? For the construction compare 2. 12. 64 ‘ lucidum fulgentes';
2. 19. 6 ‘turbidum laetatur'; 3. 27. 67 ‘perfidum ridens,' etc. ‘ La-
lagen’ takes us back to the wolf and v. 103 ‘ 1 shall be the same
Horace still, free from care and thinking of Lalage, and safe in being
the same.’ Horace doubtless felt the play on the name of ⁶ prattling’
Lalage (λαλεῖν); cp. Od. 1. 33. 2 ‘immitis Glycerae.' The choice of
the name may be due to the remembrance of Sappho's verse or the
reminiscence of Sappho to the name.

ODE XXIII.

‘ You fly from me, Chloe, like a frightened kid to its dam. Ι am not
a tiger or lion going to eat you. You are too old for such shynessff

We have possibly part of a Greek original to this Ode in a fragment
of Anacreon (Fr. 51 Bergk) :--
