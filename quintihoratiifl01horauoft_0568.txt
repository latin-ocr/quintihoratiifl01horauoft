f rHE OXFORD BIBLE FOR TEAOHERS.

‘Emattz {rum &piniana

⁸· The lai-ge collection of varied information which you have appended
to the OxFORD Bnnffl· ron Timeamus, in a form so readily available for
reference, has evidently been compiled with the greatest eare; and the
testimony which you have received to its aceuracy is a guarantee οἰ its
high value. 1 cannot doubt that the volume, in its various forms. will be of
great seivice.”-Tn1·: Asscnmsnor OF Cfflrnassunr.

“The notion of including in one volume all the helps that a clergyman
or teaeher would be likely to want sor the study of the Bible has never
been realised before with the same success that you have attained in the
OXFORD Bisstz Fon Tmonnsss. In the small edition (Ruby 16mo. thiu), by
the use of paper very skilfnlly adapted to the purpose, there is a Bible
with an Atlas, a Concordance, an Index, and several Tractates on various
points of Biblical antiquity, the whole, in a very solid binding, weighing
, a, pound and an ounce: no great weight for what is really a miniature
library. The clergy will probably give the preference to the larges· book,
marked No. 4. This includes the Apocrypha, with all the helps to the use
οἵ the Bible that distinguish the series⁴ Its type is excellent. Many clei-gy-
, men are obliged to write sermons when traveuing from place to place. This
volume would serve as a small library for that purpose, and not too large
' sor the most moderate portnianteau. I think that this work in some οἰ
its forms should be in the hands of every teacher. The atlas is very
clear and well printed. The explanatory work and the indices, so sar as
1 have been able to examine them. are very carefully done. Ι am glad
that ως own University has, by the preparation of this series of books,
taken a new step for the promotion of the carerul study of the Word of
God. That such will be the effect os the publication Ι cannot doubt.”—Tnn

Ancmnsnor οἳ Yonss.

“It would be difficult, 1 think. to provide for Sunday-School Teanum,
or indeed for other students of the Bible, so much valuable information
in so convenient a form as is now compi-ised in the OXFORD Bam: roa

Tmcnnas.”—Tnn Bienor OF LONDON.

 

“Having by frequent use made myselt acquainted with this edition or
the Holy Scripturas, Ι have no hesitation in saying that it is a most
valuable book. and that the explanatory matter collected in the various
appendices cannot but prove most helpful‚ both to teachers and learners, in
acquiring a more accurate and extensive knowledge of the Word of God.”
-Tnn B1snop or Iucnrmnn.
