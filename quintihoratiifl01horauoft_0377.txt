10. non auspicatos (in some good MSS. ‘inauspicatos'). Bentley
objected to the series of accusatives as prosaic, and would read ‘nostris ²
or ‘nostrorum '3 but ‘ non auspicatos' is not an epithet, but predicative:
it gives the reason of the defeats and is the link with the last stanza. It
was especially mentioned of Crassus’ expedition that ‘ proficiscentem in
Syriam diris cum ominibus tribuni plebis frustra retinere conati,’ Veli.
Pat. 2. 46.

13. paene, with ‘ delevit? ‘ While we were intent on our civil wars

secula3 it has been a gradual declension from age to age.

18. genus et domos, the young generation has viee in its blood,

22. artibus, instr. abl. as ‘ formatur‚’ ‘eruditur artibus ’3 ‘accomp-

honourable meaning. A large number of good MSS. read ‘ artubus?

23. iam nunc, Virg. G. 1. 42.

as the sons, ‘utiles bello tulit . . saeva paupertaS,⁷ etc„ 1. 12. 42.
