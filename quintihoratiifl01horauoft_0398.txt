362 HORATJI CARMJNA.

ipsa pecunia crescit! ‘ “ Cura,’' ne perdantur3 “scimea’' ut augeantur,
opes,’ Dillr.

18. maiorum, neut. gen. μειζόνων.

19. conspicuum, prolept.= ‘ita ut conspicuum fiat.'

20. equjtum decim, ‘the lesson which you preach to us, Maecenas,
by being content to be the pride of the equestrian order instead of
accepting any office which would qualify you to become a senator‚’ see
on 1. 20. 5,

²3· nudus, To join the army of the ‘nil cupientes’ he must be,
like thern, ‘nudus '; he must strip himself of the gifts of fortune which
he no longer wants, and be content with the cloak of which he speaks
in 3. 29. 54. The metaphor of the camp hardly begins till ‘castra.’
Orelli points out that the second clause, ‘transfuga . . gestio‚' is an
amplification of the first, and one which brings out more clearly, though
it does not create, the inexactness of the original metaphor. To satisfy
it completely, Horace must have been a rich man who gave up his
wealth. All he really means is, that he would choose a modest com·
petence in preference to great wealth.

2 5. contemptae, ‘which wealthier men despise.’ ‘Satis beatus unicis
Sabinis.³ Bentley takes it as ‘contemptae a se ipso,’ and so as=‘n0n
possessae,’ making it an oxymoron answering to ‘iuter opes inops’ : the
poor man possessing all things though he has nothing, the rich man a
pauper in the midst of his rieheS.

26, 27. For the mode of expressing the height of wealth see on 1.
Ι. 9 ‘ si proprio condidit horreo Quicquid de Libycis verritur areis.‘

26. quiequjd arat, the fruits of his ploughing. Strabo (6, p. 284)
speaks of the plains of North Apulia as πάμφοροί τε καὶ πολύφοροι, but
we hear of them chiefly as used for pasture. Possibly Horace, in want
of the name of a corn-growing Italian district, might insert Apulia
without weighing its pretensions very nicely (see on 1. 22. 13). He
singles out the industry of the husbandman rather than the fertility
of the soil. For the lengthening of the last syllable of ‘arat' see on
1. 3, 36.

impiger, Epod. 2. 42.

28. Cp. the similar oxymoron in Sat. 2. 3. 142 ‘ Pauper argenti positi
intus et auri)

29. Cp. the description ofhis farm, Sat. 2. 6. 1 ‘modus agri non ita
magnus, Hortus ubi et tecto vicinus iugis aquae fons Et paulum silvae
super his.’ So also Epp. 1. 16. 1—14.

30. segetis cert-a fides, The opposite is ‘fundus mendax‚’ 3. 1. 30.
Cp. Virg. G. 1. 226 ‘illos Expectata seges vanis elusit aristis?

31. Constr. ‘fallit beatior sorte (λανθάνει ὄλβιαι-τέρα οὖσα) fulgentem
fertilis Africae imperio,’ ‘is a lot happier than his, though he cannot
