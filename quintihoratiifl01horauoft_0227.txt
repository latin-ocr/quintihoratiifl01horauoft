ODE XII.

‘ What man wilt thou sing of, Clio? what demigod? what god ἶ)-
sing of, till the hill of Helicon rings his name again, or the woods of
Haemus follow to listen, as they did when Orpheus sang? What god,
but Jove first, and Pallas next, Liber, Diana, Phoebus. For demigods,
Hercules and the Twin Brethren who calm the stormy sea. And of men :
Romulus and all the Roman worthies3 Marcellus, the lustre of whose
name grows with each generation ; the Julian house, which outshines all
others as the moon outshines the stars ; Augustus, the hope of the human
race, the vicegerent of Jove himself)

The framework of the Ode is suggested by the opening of Pind.
Ol. 2 · ἀναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν;

But after the question has been asked the resemblance eeases. In Pindar
it is answered immediately: ‘The god is Zeus, the hero Hercules, the
man Theron,’ and all three are directly connected with the Olympian

victory which Theron has won.
