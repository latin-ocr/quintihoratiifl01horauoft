258 HORA TII CARMJNA.

mitting the same construction, and ‘quo locorum' as=‘quo loco.’
Cicero has ‘quo loci’; see Forc. s.v.

4. sera, the time would seem to be autumn.

5. allabores, a word peculiar to Horace = ‘laborando addas!

6. curo, Bentley conjectures ‘cura’ (imperative), thinking ‘curo'
not a sufficiently peremptory way of expressing a wish to a slave ‘ni
Saturnalia tunc agebantur? But the negative really qualifies it, so that
it =‘ non curo quidquam allabores.’

7. arta, not allowed to throw its arms abroad, but tied close over a ·
trellis, or otherwise, so as to give shade.

BOOK ΙΙ.
ODE I.

‘Pollio is writing the tale of the civil wars‚ a difficult and delicate
task. We can afford to let even his tragedies wait awhile‚ till the great
and brave orator of the sorum and the senate, and the conqueror of
Illyria, has given us his history. In our eagerness we seem already to
hear the trumpets and see the flashing armonr, to hear him reading to
us of the fall of chieftains and the conquest of all the world save Cato's
stubborn soul. Ay, Jugurtha is avenged now! What land or sea is
not red with the blood of our fratricidal wars? But stay, my Muse,
these are no themes for you.’

There is nothing to fix very definitely the date of the Ode. The
expressions of the first two stamas, ‘ nondum expiatis,' ‘ cineri doloso,'
perhaps attract it to the Odes (such as 1. 2 and 14) which dwell more
on the troubles from which the State had already escaped than on the
new and peaceful order on which it had entered. Augustus is not
mentioned. Pollio had not sided with him, and had certainly been
a friend of M. Antony. But the Ode expresses, as strongly as Od. 1. 2,
that weariness of bloodshed which had induced men to acquiesce in
the rule of one.

C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and supporter of Julius Caesar, having
passed through the Consulship in B.C. 40 (Virg. E. 4), and won the
honours of a triumph for his campaign against the Illyrians (ib. 8. 6-13)‚
withdrew from public life, and, in the subsequent struggle between
Antony and Octavius, remained honourably neutral. He was a mag-
nificent patron of literature, and is famous as having established the
first public library at Rome out of the spoils of his Illyrian campaign.
