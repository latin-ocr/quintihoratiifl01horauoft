fuisse piam,’ etc. with vv. 45, 46 of the Ode, vv. 35, 36 with 41 soll„
vv. 73, 74 ‘ Surge age, Belide, de tot modo fratribus unus3 Nox tibi, ni
properas, ista perennis erit,' with vv. 37, 38, and vv. 127-130 with v. 51,
see note.

Ritter suggests that the story would be especially familiar to the
Roman public at the time when Horace was writing these Odes, from
the fact that a group of the Danaids formed a chief feature in the portico
of the temple of Apollo on the I’alatine, which Augustus dedicated in
nc. 28 (see Od. 1. 31). Prop. 3. 23. 4, Ov. A.A. 1. 73, id. Am. 2. 2. 3.

Line 1. Mercuri. Mercury is coupled with the ‘testudo‚’ χέλυς (Hom.
Hymn. Merc. 47 soll.)‚ of which he was the mythical inventor. The
whole tortoise-shell was used as a sounding bottom, the horns (πήχεις)
rising from its end and supporting the ζύγον, from which the strings
were stretchcd to it. See Diet. Ant.

nam te, etc. gives the reason for addressing the prayer to Mercmy,
and so is=‘ potes nam,' Epod. 17. 45.

docilis, paired with ‘te magistro,' ‘an apt pupil, with thee for his ⁴
master.‘

2. Amphion; Α.Ρ. 394 ‘Dictus et Amphion Thebanae conditor
arcis Saxa movere sono testudinis.’

3. septem nervis; Hom. 1. c. 51 Ἑπτὰ δὲ συμφώνους ὀΐων ἐτανύσσατο
χορδάς. The substitution of the octave for the tetrachord is claimed for
himself by Terpander (Fr. Ι, ed. Bergk), who lived about 650 B.c.

5. loquax, as λάλοςεεῦλαλος. Theoc. uses λαλεῖν of musical sounds.

6. Compare Virgil's expression ‘dis et mensis accepta seeundis,' G.
2. 101.

10. exsultim, ἅπαξ λε’γ.

metuit tangi; see on 2. 2. 7.

12. eruda=‘nondum matura’; Virg. Aen. 7. 53 ‘Iam matura viro,
iam plenis nubilis annis.’

13. comitesque, to be taken with ‘ducere‚' so that the adjective
covers ‘tigres' as well as ‘silvas’3 see on 1. 2. 1, 1. 5. 6, and for the
position of‘que' on Ι. 30. 6. The reference in the following lines is
to the story of Orpheus; cp. 1. 12. 8 foll„ 2. 13. 33 foll„ Virg. G. 4.
481 foll.

15. immanis. It is a question whether the adjective agrees with
‘ianit0r,’ as Virg. Aen. 6. 400 ‘ingens ianitor,' or with ‘aulae' Orelli
is probably right in preferring the latter, as ‘aulae’ seems to want an
identifying epithet. Cp. Sil. 2. 551 ‘insomnis lacrimosae ianitor aulae?

blandienti; Od. 1. 12. 11, 1. 2413.
