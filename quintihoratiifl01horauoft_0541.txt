INDEX OF ME TgeES. 505

which did not by their accent counteract that natural sameness
of movement which we find undisguised in Alcaeus, λαῖφος
δέ πᾶν ζάδηλων ἤδη, etc. No quadrisyllabic ending or beginning
is found in Book iv except of the forms of ‘Nomen beati qui
Deorum' and ‘ Consulquc non unius anni.' Verses of the form

1 of ί(ζειῑιάρε, apricos necte flores' (1. 26. 7) are found only in 1. 16,
26, 29, 35, and 2. 1, 3, 13, 14, 19. ‘ Hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro'

in 1.26. 11 is unique. It was the occurrence of these two verses
in 1. 26, and of the verse ‘Alcaee plectro dura navis ⁷ in 2. 13,
that called Lachmann’s attention to the wrong date assigned
by Franke, on Justinus’ authority, to the quarrel of Phraates
and Tiridates, and consequently to these Odes, which thus
became specimens of Horace’s later instead of his earlier handi—
work, see Introd. to Books i—iii, § 8.

There is no synaphea between the verses of the stanza, but
Horace twice allows an elision ofa hypermetric syllable at the
end of the third verse, 2. 3. 27 and 3. 29. 35. There is an
analogous licence taken in the Asclepiad metre in 4. 1. 35, and
Virgil allows it in the hexameter, Georg. 1. 295, etc.

ἕ 3. The Sczpplzz'c stanza is found in twenty-five Odes :—

1. 2, 10, 12, 20, 22, 25, 30, 32, 38;
2. 2, 4, 6, 8,10, 163
3. 8,11‚14,18‚ 20, 22, 27;
4. 2, 6, 11 ;
and in the Carm. Sec.
It employs two kinds of verse, the lesser Sapphic, which is

repeated three times—

—u———·,Jw—u—⁸‘—²‚

and the Adonic—

-υυ-Ξ.

The materials of the rhythm in this are the same as in the
Alcaic. It is a sequence of trochees and dactyls. This is

obscured in Horace, (1) by his excluding the trochee absolutely
from the second place, where it is often found in Sappho, and
in her first Latin imitator, Catullus, αῖ δὲ μὴ φιλεῖ ταχέως φιλάσει,
‘ Pauca nunt'iate meae puellae’ 3 (2) by his eschewing the break
