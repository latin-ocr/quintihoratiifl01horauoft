Juv, 14. 22S:—or possibly merely ‘ gave existence to‚’ meaning the same
really as ‘ posuit,’ and only the vehicle for the second idea, which is to
be looked for in ‘sacrilega manu‚’ just as the verb is varied again in
v. 10 to ‘ statuit‚’ which has to carry ‘in meo agro?

in perniciem, ‘to be the destruction‚' as ‘iuvenescit . . in mea vota,‚'

1 ‘to pay my vow,' 4. 2. 56; ‘ in classem cadit omne nemus‚' ‘to form the

fleet‚' Luc. 1. 306.
5. crediderim, cp. Sat. Ι. 5. 44 ‘contulerim.' The subjunctive of

6. fregisse cervicem, Epod. 3. 1 ‘Parentis olim si quis impia manu

8. Colcha, poisons such as Medea used, Epo-cl. 3. 9, 17. 35. The
good MSS. are divided between ‘ Colcha' and ‘Colchica.’ If we read
the first it is the only instance of the collision of a short open vowel at
the end of one Alcaic stanza and a vowel at the commencement of the
next. If the latter, it is the only instance of synapheia between Alcaic
stanzas. Horace more commonly prefers the gentile form to the pos-
sessive, ⁶ Maura unda,‘ ‘ Italo caelo‚’ etc„ see on 1. 1. 28.

10. tractavit, for the slight zeugma in ‘ tractare venena et nefas‚' cp.
1. 15. 12 ‘aegida currumque et rabiem parat.'

11. caducum, ¹ ea natura ut cadere5,' see on 3. 4. 44.

13. ‘ What special danger each should avoid, man is never sorewarned
from hour to hour as he had need be.’

15. Poenus. So the MSS. and the Schol. without exception3 but it
is difficult to see the special relation between ‘ Poenus' and ‘Bosporum.'
·Aut Bosporum pro quolibet freto dixit aut Poenum pro quolibet nauta;
multum enim divisus est Poenus a Bosp0r0‚' Aer. The suggestion,
endorsed by Orelli, that ‘Poenus' can be used for ‘Phoenician,' i.e.
‘Tyriam' requires proof. That the two words are etymologically identical
is an argument, as Mr. Munro remarks, which would equally show that
‘Yankees' might now be used convertibly with ‘English‚’ of which it
was originally an Indian corruption. Lachmann's correction ‘Thynus '
or ‘'l‘hoenus' is tempting. Bithyniam commerce is often mentioned in
Horace, Carthaginian neven and the Bithyniam sailor'sgfirst difficulty
would be the passage of the Bosporus.
