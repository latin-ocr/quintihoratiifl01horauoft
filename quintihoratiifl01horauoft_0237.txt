NOTES. BOOKJ‚ ODE XV. 201

3. ingrato, to the winds themselves, as in Virg. Aen. 1. 55 ‘llli
indignantes magno cum murmure montis Circum claustra fremunt.'

5. Dillr. remarks on the weight given to the words ‘ Nereus sata'
by their reservation to this place, the name of the speaker, and the
nature of his words. They bespeak attention for the prophecy which

sOItlxiiang avi, Od. 3. 3. 6 ‘alite lugubri 'z Epod. 10. 1 ‘mala alite'3 Od.

4. 6. 23 ‘ potiore alite‚' like the Gr. ὅρνις, οἰωνός.

7. rumpere, by a zeugma (Madv. ξ 478, obs. 4) with ‘ nuptias ’ and
‘regumn’ The union of the two objcets under the one verb helps the
feeling that the same Μαῖα will effect both purposes.

9. Hom. 11, 2. 388 ἱδρώσει μέν τευ τελαμὼν . . ἱδρώσει δέ τευ ἵππος.

10. quanta funera, ‘what a scene of death !’ Virg. Aen. 8. 537 ‘ Heu
quantae miseris caedes Laurentibus instant.' See I‘orc. sor this use of
⁴ quanti’ with a plural, where we should expect ‘ quot.’ The strongest
instance quoted from an Augustam writer is Prop. 1. 5. 10 ‘Ae tibi
curarum milia quanta dabit? It is poetical, and seems to include the
notion osmagnitude as well as ofnumber‚ ⁶ What a mighty host oscares ! ’

moves, used, without any definite metaphor, of ‘ setting in motion‚’
⁴ beginning‚' ⁵ causing.'

Dardanae, Od. 4. 6. 7. The poets, and especially Horace, use the
names of nations aud tribes as adjective-s instead of the fuller derivative
forms in -ius or deus. ‘ Marsus aper,' Od. 1. 1. 283 ⁴ Medum flumen,'
2. 9. 21; ‘Afro murice‚‘ 2. 16. 35; ‘Thyna merce‚’ 3. 7. 3. They
extend the liberty even to the proper names of individuals, as here; cp.
C. S. 47, Od. 4. 5. 1 ‘ Romulae genti’; Virg. Aen. 6. 877 ‘Romula
tellus.'

12. currusque et rabiem, her ruge is one of its own weapons, as
Aeneas in Virg. Aen. 12. 107 ‘ acuit mentem et se suscitat ira'; and
Hecuba, in Ov. Met. 13. 554 ⁴ se armat et instruit ira.' For the union
of abstract and concrete, Orelli quotes Hom. 11. 3. 447 σὺν δ’ ἔβαλον
ῥινούς, σὺν δ’ ἔγχεα, καὶ μένε’ ἀνδρῶν, and Hor. Od. Ι. 35. 33 ‘ cicatri—
cum et sceleris.’

13 soll. Hom. Il. 3. 54 οὐκ ἅν τοι χραίσμῃ κίθαρις τά τε δῶρ’ Ἀφρο-
δίτης Ι ἥ τε κόμη. τό τε εἶδος, ὅτ’ ἐν κονίῃσι μιγείης.

15. divides. The meaning is doubtful. Orelli understands by it
‘ halve the song with the guitar.’ i. e. between the voice and the guitar,
‘make the guitar take half the song.' Or it may conceivably mean
‘mark the time of songs‚' ‘ accompany them.' Cp. Luc. 2. 688 ‘buc-
cina dividat horas.’ ‘tell the hours‚' i. e. ‘mark their divisions! Dillr.
gives it a simpler sense, comparing Od. 1. 36. 6 ‘sodalibus . . dividit
oscula‚' ‘ sing to one and another’3 ‘seminis’ will theu depend, ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ, on ‘ grata' and ‘ diuides:
