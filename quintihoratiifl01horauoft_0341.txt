ther on.

22. ‘Not rich enough to thy taste in t'ne possession of the shore of
the mainlan‹l.’

continente is also taken as ‘ adjoining.' Orelli supports the present
use by Liv. 44. 28 ‘ continenti litore.'

ripa, of the seashore, as in 3. 27. 23.

23. quid quod, used always to introduce some stronger argument
or charge. Here it is equivalent to · Nay, worse ἲ ’

usque proximos, τοὺς ἀεὶ ὁμόρους.

24. revellis, Fest. in v. Terminus ‘ Numa Pompilius statuit eum qui
terminum exararet et ipsum et boves sacrum esse.'

³5. clientium. Virgil places among the blackest erilnes punished
in Tartarus ‘fraus innexa clienti‚' Aen. 6. 609. Cp. the law of the
Twelve Tables, ‘ Patronus si clienti fraudem fecerit sacer esto?

26. salis, of the levity with which the crime is committed, as if the
client's right was no obstacle at all. Compare the use of ⁴ t1·ansili1-e‚'
1. 3. 24, ι. 18. 7.

30. Orci fine. Ritter takes this as a local ablativez‘in finibus·
Orci‚’ quoting for the singular, Od. 1. 34. 11 ‘Atlanteus'finisf It is
more probably instrumental‚ ⁴ by the limit of Orcus⁷ being equivalent
to ⁴ by Orcus, who sets a limit to all things.' ‘ Mors ultima linea
rerum‚' Epp. Ι. 16. 79. There may be a remembrance of the Gr. τέλος
θανάτοιο. That it should interfere to some extent with the personifi-'
cation would not, in interpreting Horace, be a fatal objection (see 011
