ODE V.

‘ Jove's thunder proves him the sovereign of the sky. Augustus shall
prove himself a god upon earth by adding to the empire Britain and the
hateful Parthians—O shame to think of the disgrace not yet wiped
away !———Roman soldiers living as captives, sorgetful of name and
country, and country's gods, This was the danger that Regulus soresaw
if prisoners were allowed to hope for ransom—“ Let them die‚’' he said,
“ and pity them not. Ι have seen with my own eyes the sight of shame:
Roman standai-ds nailed up in Punic temples with armour that was
,taken not from the dead but from the living t—Roman citizens with their
hands bound behind their backs—Carthage peaceful and busy t—the
work of our war undone. Will you buy those soldiers back again ? It
will be a waste of money. The deer caught in the net does not fight
again if you loose it, nor does the man who has once feared death make
a soldier again. He does not know what war means.'’ He put aside
his wife and children, and hung his head as one disgraced, till the senate
listened to his advice ; then he went back to torture and death with ast
light a heart as if he were going for a holiday.’

Another phase of Augustus’ rule. He is to retrieve the deeply-felt
disgrace of Charrae‚ and to restore the healthy military spirit of ancient
Rome. W'e have in the story of Regulus at once a measure of the
disgrace to be retrieved‚—‘ It is the very disgrace which he feared and
foretold and went back to the torture in order to prevent,'—an(l a
picture of the true Roman spirit which is to be reawakened.

The whole sentiment of the speech may be compared with Liv. 22.
59-61.

The story of Regulus⁷ mission to Rome is not found in Polybius, a
fact which has been held to throw doubt on its truth. It is summarized
in the Epitome of Liv. 18. With Cicero it is a commonplace. It is
told at length in the De Off. 3. 27, a passage of which Horace recalls
several turns of thought and expression. ‘ M. Attilius Regulus, cum
consul iterum in Africa ex insidiis captus esset, duce Xanthippo Lace-
daemonio, imperatore autem patre Hannibalis Hamilcare, iuratus missus
