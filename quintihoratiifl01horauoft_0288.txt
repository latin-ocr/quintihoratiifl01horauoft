252 HORATII CARMINA.

Line 1. fidibus, of music at a sacrifice. Cp. Od. 4. 1. 21.

2. placare, a general word for ‘to secure the favour' of the
gods, without implyIng that they were angry before. Cp. Od. 5.
23. 3.

debito; cp. in the parallel Ode 2. 7. 17 ‘ obligatam redde Iovi dapem,’
‘due,' whether it had been actually vowed or not.

4. Hesperia, ‘the West.y To the Greeks Italy was the ‘western
land‚’ and so we find the word used iu Virgil. Horace himself uses it
of Italy as compared with Parthia, Od. 2. 1. 32. In Roman mouths
generally it would mean the countries still further west, and be used
of Spanish wars, etc.

8. non alio rege, see on Od..4. Ι. 4 ‘ sub regno Cinarae.’ The ex-
pression seems partly to be due to the common mode of eomputing
dates, ‘consule Planco] βασιλεύοντος Κύρου, etc., partly to contain a
description qs the imperious character os the rule, there of a mistress,
here osa schoolmaster‚ like Horace's own ‘plagosus Orbilius.’

puertiae. For the syncope cp. ‘lamna,' Od. 2. 2. 2, Epp. 1. 15. 36;
‘ surpuerat,' Od. 4. 13. 20; ‘somus' S. Ι. 2. 113, 2. 5. 65.

9. mutatae . . togae, i.e. the assumption of the ‘toga virilis ' instead
of the ⁸praetexta ' at the age of fifteen.

10. Cressa nota. Bentley seems to have been the first to suggest
that by ‘ Cressa nota’ Horace meant ⁵ a mark of Cretan stone,‘ i. e. of
chalk‚ called ‘cretas or supposed to be called so, for the reason for
which the Greeks called fuller's earth Κιμωλία γῆ (Ar. Ran. 713, Ov.
Met. 7. 463 ‘Cretosaque rura Cimoli') from Cimolus‚ one of the
Cyclades, whence they obtained it. He pointed out that where he is
writing ‘sermoni propiora,⁷ he calls it simply ‘creta’; S. 2. 3. 246
‘ Creta an carbone notandi.' Horace is referring to what was doubtless
merely a proverbial mode of expression among the Romans. Pliny
attributes it as an actual custom to a Thracian tribe, ‘quae calculos
colore distinctos pro experimento cuiusque diei in urnam condit ac
supremo die separatos dinumerat atque ita de quoque pronunciat‚'
N. H. 7. 40. The Latin poets are full of allusions to such a fancied
symbolic practice. Cp. Mart. 12. 34 (where he is reviewing his thirty-
four years of intercourse with his kinsman Jul. Martialis) ‘Quarum
dulcia mista sunt amaris, Sed iucunda tamen fuere plura: Et si cal-
culus omnis huc et illuc Diversus bicolorque digeratur Vincet ean-
dida turba nigriorem.’ For briefer references, Catull. 68. 148 ‘Quem
lapide illa diem candidiore notat '; 106. 6 ‘ O lucem candidiore nota'3
Pers. 2. 1 ‘ Hunc Macrine diem numera meliore lapillo.’ Some early
critics altered ⁶ Cressa’ to ‘Thressa,' on the ground apparently of the
story in Pliny. The Schol. justisy ‘ Cressa ' by relating the same story
of the Cretans ; but, as Bentley remarked, whether they were Thraeians
