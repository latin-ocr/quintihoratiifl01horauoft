EPODE IX.

‘ When shall we have our feast, Maecenas, to celebrate Caesar's victory
as we celebrated the defeat os Sextus Pompeius a little while ago? Oh,
the shame to think os Roman soldiers in Cleopatra's effeminate camp!
Even Galatiam horsemen deserted her. and her fleet would not fight. ¹
Why is not the triumphal procession already moving—-the triumph osa ῑ
captain greater than Marius or the younger Scipio? Our foe has changed 1
his scarlet for momning, and fied across the sea with no hai-bour to go
to. Bring wine, boy, and the largest cups3 we may forget all our ¹
anxieties sor Caesar's welfare.’ ¹

Compare Od. 1. 37 Introd., Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 1, and Introd. to ;
the EpodeS. This Epode is manifestly written on the receipt of the
news of the battle of Actium, and before the subsequent fate of Cleo-
patra and Antony was known, when even the direction of their flight
was a matter of conjecture, vv. 29 -32-

Line 3. alta domo, the palace of Maecenas on the Esquiline.

4. beate, ‘ cui omnia ex voto cadunt,' Orelli; ⁴ happy‚'—partly in all
the splendour about him, an epithet to harmonize with ‘festas‚' ‘ alta‚’
etc., which express Horace's anticipation of the banquet which is to
match the occasion,—partly in the news of this crowning victory of his
friend and his policy.

5. tibiis, lyra. The two instruments are used even at Homer's ban-
quets; Il. 18. 495 αὐλοὶ φόρμιγγές τε βοὴν ἕχον. Cp. Od. 3. 19. 16-18.
There is a doubt, however, whether ‘ mixtum’ must be pressed to mean
that they were used at the same moment⁷ as the next verse would then
imply not merely that the two instruments but the two ‘modes' or
⁴ scales‚’ ἡ Δωριστί and ἡ Φρυγιστὶ, could be played together (see Dict.
Ant. eud of Article on Greek Music). For the plural ‘tibiis' see on l
Od. 1. 1. 32. ¹
