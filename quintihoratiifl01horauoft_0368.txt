332 HORA TII CARMINA.

55. Rhoetus, Hor. Od. 2. 19. 23.

56. Enceladus, Virg. Aen. 3. 578.

57. Palladis, see note on v. 49. The goddess of wisdom is the cen-
tral figure. By her side (⁴ hinc . . hinc‘) are ranged all the other gods ;
but of the three named to represent them if one is characterised by fiery
zeal, the other two suggest queenly dignity and poetic grace.

58. avidus, absol. as in Tac. Ann. 1. 51 ‘avidae legiones’3 more
usually with a genitive, as ‘ avidus pugnae,’ Virg. Aen. 12. 430. Homer’s
λιλαιόμενος πολέμοιο. ,

60. *Ἆᾞοιῃ they could never hope to find unarmed and unprepared
sor battle.’ The following stanza is intended to accumulate images of
Apollo, his grace of form aud his pursuits, which contrast with the ‘un-
couth and brutal Titans,' his haunts by streams and woodland, the
fount of the Muses, the long hair of youth and of the bard (see on 4.
6. 26). We may note, also, in illustration os vv. 63, 64, that when
virgil would express Aeneas’ beauty and grace of movement, he com—
pares him to Apollo leading the dance in Delos, when he revisits it from
Lycia (Aen. 4. 144).

61. lavit. For the form see on 2. 3. 18.

63. natalem silvam, Virg. l. c. ‘maternam Delon.’ For other
notices of Apollo’s migration between Patara and Delos see Herod. 1.
82, Pind. P. 1. 39.

65. Eur. Fr. Temen. 11 ῥώμη δέ ’γ’ ἀμαθὴς πολλάκις τίκτει βλάβην.

66. temperatam, ‘ under control '; possibly, as Conington suggests,
with a reference to the use of ⁶ temperare vinum ⁷ ; ‘tempered‚’
‘softened,’ by the admixture of mind. Orelli points out how the
repetition of ‘ vis,⁷ ‘ vim,’ ‘ vires‚' marks the application of the preceding
stanzas.

69. testis mearum sententiarum. It is rather a rough and prosaie
turn sor Horace: but he is probably trying to be Pindaric. See on
4. 4. 18. On the variance of the MSS. between Gyas and Gigas see on
2. 17. 14.

70. integrae, i. q. ‘ intactae,' τῆς ἀεὶ παρθενοῦ.

71. tentator, ἅπαξ λε’γ. from the Greek πειραστής.

73. dolet, is still in pain.

suis, i.e. ‘ se natis.'

75. peredit, has eaten a way through, so as to set them free.

76. impositam, according to Pindar and Aeschylus, on Typhoeus;
according to Yirgil (Aen. 3. 578). on Eneeladus3 according to Calli-
machus (Hymn. in Del. 141), on Briareus.

celer, for all its haste.

77. Tityi, 2. 14. S, 3. 11. 21, 4. 6. 2, Hom. Od. 11. 576 foll. Pind. P.
