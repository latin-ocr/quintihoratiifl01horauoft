204 HORA TII CARMJNA.

as Newrnan says. to make the occasion slightly ridiculous, to represent
both himself and the lady as having made too much ofit.

The παλινῳδία of Stesichorus, which added to the legend of Troy the
famous variation that it was only a phantom in Helen's shape that Paris
carried from Mycenae. is mentioned by Plato, Phaedr. 243 A, who quotes
the first three lines :—

οὔκΙ ἐστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος
οὐδ’ ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμοις
οὐδ’ ἵκεο Πέργαμα Τροίας.

Acron’s statement, ‘Stesichorum i1nitatur‚’ can barely mean more than
that Horace took from him the idea of a ‘ palinode.’ Ritter suggests
thal the first line may be an echo of some line in which Stesichorus
addressed Helen as sairer than her mother Leda.

Line 2. modum pones, ⁶ modum ponere! ⁶ to set bounds,’‘ cupidinibus,
orationi,’ ete„ are common expressions, cp. Od. 3. 15. 2 ‘nequitiae fige
modum.’ There is a play in its extension here to mean simply ‘to put
an end to,' i.e. ‘destr0y.’ The verses have been intemperate, the lady
shall put bounds to them in the only possible way. Compare Ovid’s
trope, “ Emendaturis ignibus‚’ Trist. 4. 10. 62.

3. pones, the permissive suture, ‘you shall if you wish‚’ see on Od.
1. 6. 1.

4. Hadriano, see on Od. 1. 1. 14.

5-9. ‘ Ira furor brevis est! ‘ No divine afflatus makes those it
possesses so reekless as the passion of anger.’

5. Dindymene, ⁴ Dea Dindymi‚’ Catull. 62. 91, a mountain in Phrygia
where Cybele was worshipped.

non adytis . . incola Pythius. It seems best to take this as a
slight inversion, after Horaee's manner, sor ‘adytis Pythiis incola? ‘not
in his shrine at Pytho the god who (lwells there '; comp. Epod. 10. 12
¹ Graia victorum manus ² sor the more usual ⁴ Graiorum.³ For the mode
of deseribing the god, comp. Virg. Aen. 3. 111 ⁴ mater cultrix Cybelae.'
Possibly ‘ incola’ may have a stronger soree, and represent Pindar’s οὐκ
ἀπόδαμος τυχών (Ργῐὴ. 4. 7), ‘ when his presence is there ’ς with reference
to the migrations osgods from one shrine to another. Dillenburger's in-
terpretation is less likely. He takes ‘sacerdoturnss ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, with
⁶ incola’ as well as with ‘ mentem? ⁵ his priests' hearts when he possesses
them,’ quoting Plutarch de Orac. Des. p. 414 e. τὸν θεὸν αὐτὸν . .

adytis is opposed to the more widely diffused afflatus, ἐνθουσιασμός,
of Cybele or Bacchus.
