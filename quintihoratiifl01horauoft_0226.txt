190 HORA ΤΗ CARMINUM

Homeric Hymn εἷς Ἑρμῆν, 20. The construction is ‘dum terret nisi
reddidisses: ‘is trying to frighten you with threats of what he will do
is you do not return the kine.’ In stricter grammar it would be either
‘ reddideris ' or ‘ terrebat.'

11. viduus risit, like ‘ sensit delapsus,’ laughed to find himself
robbed.

14. dives, with his rich presents, ἀπερείσι’ ἄποινα, see Hom. 11. 24.
228 foll. Mmcury, the best of thieves, is the best of guardians against
theft, like Plato’s δεινὸς φύλαξ φὼρ δεινός, Republ. p. 334.

15. ignes . . iniqua, it was neither because they were not watching,
nor because they were friends, that he was able to pass safely.

17. foll. His functions as ψυχοπομπός. The ‘ levis turba: the
‘shadowy throng,' εἴδωλα καμόντων, are distinguished from the fewer
‘ piae animae.’

18. coerces, of keeping a flock together, preventing them straying
by the way, Od. 1. 24. 18. Hermes carries ῥάβδον χρυσείην when he
drives the suitors' souls to Hades in Hom. Od. ²4· 1 soll.

ODE XI.

‘Do not go to the Astrologers, Leuconoe. Better bear life as it
comes; enjoy the present, and think as little as possible about the
future.5

On the ‘ mathematiei' see Dict. Ant. s. v. Astrologia3 ‘ genus
hominum potentibus infidum sperantibus fallax quod in civitate nostra
et vetabitur semper et 1‘etinebitur,' Tac. Hist. 1. 22. Horace himself
was not above an interest in* the superstition of the (lay, see Od. 2. 17,
and Sat. 1. 6. 113.

The name of Leuconoe is chosen doubtless in part at least as a pretty
sounding name which* suits the Ch ’ ὼίο metre. as Neobule and
Liparaeus suit the Ionic a minore of d. 3. 12. It is possible also that
Horace may have looked to its etymology, but it is hard for us to say
whether it would have conveyed a complimentary sense or the ,reverse3 3
‘candida’ or ‘ clara mente’ say some of his editors, ‘empty-n‘iilndjdsl
say others. Pindar's hengwita& Pyth. 4. 194, which is quoted in '⁴
support of the latter view, seems rather to imply ‘malignity’ than
‘ solly.'

Metre—Sccond A sclcpz'ad.

Line 1. tu, see on Od. 1. 9. 16. · The use of the pronoun emphasizes
the prayer, ⁶ Pray do not.’

quaesieris, Madv. ξ 386. The perf. subj. is more usual than the
pres. subj. or imperative in prohibitions addressed to the second person.
⁶ Hoc facito; hoc ne seceris‚’ Cic. Div. 2. 61.
