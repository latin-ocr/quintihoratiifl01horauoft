NOTES. BOOK JV, ODE XIV. 445

original idea was of the horn-like branchings of a river, or of its violence,
or of its roaring; μεμυκὼς ἠΰτε ταῦρος, Hom. Il. 21. 237, of the Xanthus.
Cp. ‘longe sonans‚' of the Aufidus, 4. 9. 2. But whatever was its origin,
Horace probably feels the image suggested by the epithct through the
following lines; so that there is almost a simile within the simile.

Tiberius is like the Aufidus in flood: the Aufidus is like a bull charg-
ing down the mountain side.

26. Dauni Apuli; 3. 30. 10.

praefluit3 4. 3. 10.

28. meditatur. The good MSS. are divided between this word and
‘minitatum' Porph. read ‘meditatur,' though some little doubt is
thrown on his testimony also by variance of MSS„ and Servius quotes
it to illustrate Georg. 3. 153. ‘ Minitatur’ is the most likely to have
been a gloss. The true answer to Porph.’s criticism ‘ maledixit “ medi-
tatur ’' quia in ipso actu est nec debet cogitare aut condiscere quod iam
facit‚’ seems to be that the image is not of the river actually flooding
the lowlands, but of the boiling waters of its upper course filling its
channel to the brim, and threatening a flood to the lower levels.

30. diruit. This verb, more commonly used of laying buildings in
ruin, is justified here, on the one side, by the image of the river, ὅς τ’
ὦκα ῥέων ἐκέδασσε γεφύρας (Hom. l. c.) ; on the other, by the epithet of
‘agmina'3 the ‘steelclad lines' are looked at as fortifications which

, were to be levelled.

31. primos et extremos, all alike, first rank and last rank.

metend03 Virg. Aen. 10. 513 ‘proxima quaeque metit gladio? In
Hom. Il. ΙΙ. 67 it is a complete simile: οἱ δ’ ὥστ’ ἀμητῆρες ε’νάντιον
ἀλλήλοισιν ’Όγμον ἐλαύνωσιν, κ. τ. λ.

32. stravit humum, ‘strewed the ground? The ablative of the
harvest with which he strewed it, is to be gathered from ‘ metend0‚' etc.

sine clade, i.e. without loss of his own troops; v. 13. There is this
force also in the preceding metaphors: the enemy went down before
him like corn before a mower.

33. Horace returns to the praises of Augustus. With consilium cp.
4. 4. 75 ‘ curae sagaces.’

eopias; see above, v. 9.

34. divos; v. 16 ‘auspiciis secundis.’ The ‘auspicia ' belonged to
the emperor: it was his ‘felicitas ’ that was in question. Tiberius and
Drusus were only his ⁶ legati.⁷

tibi quo die, etc. The meaning is, that this war was brought to an
end just fifteen years after Augustus' victorious entry into Alexandria.
This took place on the Kalends of August, B.C. 30. Whether we are to

press the words ‘ quo die ’ to mean on the very same day of the year,
there is nothing to determine.
