INDEX OF METRES. 507

§ 5. These metres account sor 97 out of the 104 Odes (in-
cluding the Carm. Sec), and 11 out of 17 Epodes.

Of the remaining metres, one or at the most two or three
specimens exist, which are to be viewed rather, as Mr. Munro
remarks, as experiments.

5. Alcmanium, Od. 1. 7 and 28, and Epod. 12.

lt is in couplets consisting of the common Dactylic Hex-
ameter and a Dactylic Tetrameter.

6. The couplets named from Archilochus.

Archilochium Imum, Od. 4. 7.

The common Dactylic Hexameter, followed by a Dactylic
Trimeter Catalectic (half of an Elegiae Pentameter) :—

-υυ-ῌῸΞ.

Archilochium Ilum, Epod. 13.
The Dactylic Hexameter‚ followed by an asynartete ¹ verse
called lambelegus, being composed of a Dimeter
Iambic÷half the Elegiae Pentameter:—

U—U—g—Uk—Jl-UU-ng·

Archilochium lilium, Epod. 11.

A common Iambic Trimeter, followed by a verse, also
asynartete, called Elegiambus, composed of the same
elements as the Iambelegus combined in a different
order.

Archilochium IVtum, Od. Ι. 4.

(a) A verse called Archilochius Major, consisting of a
Dactylic Tetrameter-l-three trochees. It is not in
Horace asynartete, for the fourth dactyl is always
perfect, and no hiatus is found 3 but there is a strict
caesura between the two parts of the verse.

(β) An Iambic Trimeter Catalectic.

¹ ἀσυνάρτητος, the term used for a verse of which the two parts are
imperfectly joined together, where the last syllable of the first half is
independent in scansion of the first syllable of the second hals, e. g.
Epod. 13, 8, 10, and 11. 6, 14. In this last case there is an actual
hiatus. ’
