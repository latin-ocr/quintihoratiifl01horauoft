HORACE'S USE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY INFI-
- NITIVE WITH VERBS AND ADJECTIVES.

1. W z'tlz Verbs.

A COMPLEMENTARY, or, as Dr. Kennedy prefers to call it,
‘prolative,' infinitive seems properly to have been allowed only
to verbs whose idea was not complete without such a definition
of their scope3 whether the simple verbs that express power,
duty, inclination‚ purpose, effort⁷ beginning, etc., and the nega-
tion ofany ofthese (‘ possum,' ‘ debeo,' ‘ volo‚’ ‘ conor,' ‘ incipio,'
‘neque0,' ‘nolo⁷) ; or again the simple verbs which express the
allowing another, or influencing him, to do or abstain from
doing something (‘ sino,’ ‘patior,’ ‘ iube0‚' ‘doceo,⁷ ‘ cogo‚' ‘veto,'
‘prohibeo,' eto). There is a tendency, however, even in the
most classical prose writers to extend the first at least of these
two classes by including verbs which do not properly require
any such complement, and which therefore, if any further defi-
nition of their scope or purpose were needed, would in strictness
have found it rather by means either of some subordinate clause
or of one of those substantival forms of the verb which could
indicate its special relation more exactly than is possible with
the caseless infinitive. Thus we find with the infinitive, ‘studeo,'
Cic.; ‘nitor‚⁷ Nep.; ‘quaero‚’ Cic.; ‘tendo,’ Liv.; ‘pergo,’ Cic.;
‘persevero,' Cic. Many verbs hesitate between the two con-
structions, ‘ statuo facere' or ‘ut faciam,' ‘prohibeo facere' or
‘quominus facias.³ The poets go beyond the prose writers in
this extension, greatly because their diction substitutes more
highly-coloured and metaphorical verbs for the simpler ones of
prose, ‘gaudeo,' ‘gestio‚⁷ ‘amo,' ‘ardeo,' for ‘v010‚’ etc.; but
Livy and Sallust anticipate some of the boldest poetical appli-
cations of this liberty.
