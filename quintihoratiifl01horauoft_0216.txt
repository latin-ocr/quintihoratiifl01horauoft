ODE VI.

⁶ Heroic exploits require a Homer to sing of them,' says Horace, and
so gives Agrippa the lyric glory that (it would seem) he has asked for,
while professing to leave the task of celebrating such exploits to the
epic genius of Varius. For panegyric cast in the same form compare
Od.2.12 and 4. 2.

The Ode is addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and
counsellor of Augustus, and the greatest commander of his reign. He
finally defeated Sextus Pompeius at Naulochus in ac. 36, and com-
manded at Actium in 13.c. 31. After the death of Marcellus (and con-
sequently, it would seem, after the publication of this Ode) he was
married by Augustus to his daughter Julia (3.0. 2Ῑ); was associated
with him (ac. 18) in the Tribunitian power, and was looked upon as
his intended successor. He died four years before Horace, in B.C. 12.
Horace speaks of his popularity in Sat. 2. 3. 185 ; of his subjugation of
the Cantabri in Epp. 1. 12. 263 of his engineering exploit of turning
the Lucrine lake into a harbour, though without mentioning his name,
in A. P. 63.

Line 1. scriberis· Not necessarily a definite promise or prophecy‚-
although Varius is said really to have written a ‘ Panegyricus in Cae-
sarem Octavianum' (see Epp. 1. 16. 27, where Horace is said by the
Schol. to have borrowed 2} lines from that poem) which would have
contained the exploits of Agrippa‚—but=‘ scribaris licet,' ‘ I shall leave
Varius to write of you.’ Cp. Od. 1. 7. 1 ‘laudabunt alii'; 1. 20. ιο

alite. This is the unanimous reading of the MSS; and the Pseudo-
Acr. and the Comm. Cruq. found it, for the difficulty of the ablative
made them separate it from ⁶ Vario’ and explain it by ⁴ Homericis
auspiciis? Ritter takes ‘ Vario' as a dative, and ²alite ‘ as a loose ‘ ad
sensum' apposition to it. It seems better with Orelli to take ‘ Vario . .
