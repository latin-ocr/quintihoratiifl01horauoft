NOTES. BOOKI, ODE IX. 187

8. olivum, i.e. the oil with which wrestlers anointed themselves, so
that it stands sor the ‘ palaestra.’

9. sanguine viperino, held to be a deadly poison, Epod. 3. 6.

12. armis, the ‘arma campestria' of A. P. 379, the quoit and the
javelin. It is the strain of the rnuscles in throwing that renders the arms·
‘ livida?

12. trans finem expedito. The object in throwing the ‘ discus’ was
only to throw it the greatest distance. For a description of the game,
see Hom. Od. 8. 186 foll. That which Ulysses threw ὑπέρπτατο σήματα
πάντα Ι ῥίμφα θέων ἀπὸ χειρός. ‘Expedire,’ ‘to send it clear beyond.'

14. filium Thetitis. How Achilles was concealed by his mother in
woman’s disguise‚ and how he was discovered by the way in which he
handled some weapons which Ulysses introduced in a pack of female
wares, is told by Ovid, Met. 13. 162 soll. The story is post-Homeric.

πῦρ, ἐν δὲ κίρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως

μέλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ
μάλθακον ἀμφιτίθη γνόφαλλον.

Horace has given a Roman dress to it, and the conclusion is probably
his own. The tone is the same as Od. 1. 11.

Thaliarchus seems to be a name invented for the ideal character from
its etymological meaning; a possible (though it is not found in extant
Greek literature as an actual) synonym for συμποσίαρχος.

Compare Epod. 13 with its sudden change to the singular number in
v. 6, as though he were addressing the master or the ‘ ruler of the feast,‘
‘ Tu vina Torquato move Consule pressa me0.’ The whole poem presents
a strong resemblance in thought and expression.

Line 1. stet, a natural word to use of a solitary hill which ‘ stands up'
or ‘ rises ' out of a plain; but possibly from its position it is here meant to
