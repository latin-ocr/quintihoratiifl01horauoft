NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXVIII. 231

haps it is more consistent than ‘litus' with the form of the notes os
Aer. and Porph. The Scholiast on γ read it, sor his interpretation is
‘amplum.'

4. munera, specially used of the last offiees. It does not occur to
the sailor that the sand on Archytas' body, if there be sand, has been
heaped by the wind, not by human hand, and that the tribute osa few
grains duly thrown is the one boon he still needs.

5. tentasse, as if there were some audacity in lifting even the mind
to the heavenly bodies; ‘animo' of course in sense qualifies it as well
as ⁶ percurrisse)

6. percurrisse, from Luer. 1. 73 ‘ Omne immensum peragravit mente
animoque.’

morituro, the case ruled by ‘tibi’ (Madv. ξ 393 c), the time fixed
by ‘tentasse' and ‘percurrisse' ‘What profits it you now to have
scaled the homes of the sky, and in spirit to have ranged from star to
star through the round heaven, you that had still to die!’ Cp. 2. 3. 4,
where ‘ moriture ' occupies the same emphatic position.

7 foll. The instances are of those who seemed at one time to have
escaped the universal law: Tantalus, when he feasted with the gods;
Tithonus, when he was beloved by Aurora, and snatehed by her into
the sky (Eur. Tro. 855 ὃν ἀστέρων τέθριππος ἔλαβε χρύσεος ὄχος ἀναρ-
πάσας); Minos, when Jove himself counselled him in the art of law-
giving (cp. Hom. Od. 19. 179 Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής); Pythagoras,
when he proved that he had outlived one death. The form of argument
is that of Hom. Il. 18. 117, so often imitated, οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ βίη Ἡρα-
κλῆος φύγε κῆρα Ι ὅσπερ φίλτατος ἔσκε Διῒ Κρονίωνι ἄνακτι Ι . . ὣς καὶ
ἐγών, κ.τ.λ. Horace uses the myths of Tantalus and Tithonus (‘ longa
Tithonum minuit senectus,' Od. 2. 16. 30) for other purposes elsewhere;
here we are not to think of the punishment of the one or the old age
of the other, only of the fact that, though privileged above humanity,
they died at last like others.

10. ‘And the son of Panthus is in Tartarus now since he descended
a second time to the lower world, for all that before (for he took down
his shield and proved his knowledge of the days of Troy) he had yielded
to black death no spoils beyond mere sinews and skin.‘ Pythagoras
was said to have supported his doctrine of μετεμψύχωσις by asserting
that his own soul had animated the body of Euphorbus (Πάνθου υἱὸν
ἐϋμμελίην, whom Menelaus slew, Hom. Il. 17. 69), a fact which he
proved by reeognizing Euphorbus’ shield hung with others in a temple
at Argos.

Tartara, not of the place of punishment, but of the lower world
generally, as in Virg. G. Ι. 36, where the Elysian plains seem to be
included in it. No ‘distinction is intended between ‘Tartara’ and ‘Orco.’
