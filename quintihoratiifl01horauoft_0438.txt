ODE II.

‘ As vain sor any of us to imitate Pindar as to soar on wings ofIcarus;
Pindar rolls doun strong and deep, as a river in fl00d‚ supreme alike in
dithyrambs, hymns, ἐπινίκια, θρῆνοι, He soars on the winds, the swan
of song: I fly from flower to flmver, like the bee of my native Apulia,
and roam from wood to wood gathering my little store of poetic honey.
Some day, Antonius, when Caesar comes home, some greater poet such
as you must sing his triumph,-—Caesar‚ the best and greatest gift which
heaven ever gave to earth, even in the golden age, our joy at receiving
him back, our games, our holiday. Even Ι may find a voice then amid
the happy multitude. we will all shout and rejoice and offer incense;
you will offer a lordly sacrifice, as befits you, 1 a home-bred calf.’

Julus Antonius was the son of the Triumvir by Fulvia, and was
educated by his step-mother Octavia. Through her protection he was
spared when his brother Marcus Antyllus was slain, and rose eventually
ιο high favour with Augustus-5 and was married to Marcella, Octavia's
daughter, after her divorce from Agrippa in nc. 21. Horace's Ode is
the only ancient authority for his having been a poet; but the Pseudo·
Acron vouches for his having written an excellent Epic poem in twelve
Books, called the Diomedeia, some years afterwards. He was made
praetor in B.C. 13, and consul in Rc. 10. In B.c. 2 he was condemned to
death on the charge of adulterous intercourse with Julia. ,

On the bearing of the Ode see Introd. p. 258. It does not follow, of 1
course, that the Ode was written after the later Odes. It may well be,
as F ranke thinks, that the omission of any reference to the successes of
Tiberius and Drusus makes it improbable that it was written aster the
year 15.

With the form of the Ode, refusing praise in word, yet granting it in
the act of refusal both directly and indirectly, comp. 1. 6, and 1. 12.

Line 2. Iule. The use of the praenomen was a mark of familiarity
(Sat. 2. 5. 32) which Horace would be likely to avoid. In this case,
however, it would be felt as a compliment‚ as the name (not properly a
‘ praenomen,’ but family names were used as praenomina at this date;
cp. ‘ Paulus ’ in the last Ode) had been given him (possibly by Octavia)
to mark the connection of his family with the Julian house, through his
grandmother Julia, the mother of Marc Antony. In v. 26 we have the
