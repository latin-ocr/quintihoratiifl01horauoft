NOTES. BOOXJ2 ODE XXXI. 239

ἀπαιτεῖν, etc. Foreell. quotes sor the use two fragments of Alfenus
Varus and Scaevola contained in the Digest, ‘ alios boves his numis
reparare‚’ ¹ messes reparare '; see on Od. 1. 37. ²4 ‘latentes Classe cita
reparavit oraS.’ Bentley, denying this use of ‘ repar0‚' alters that
passage and interprets this, ‘condita vel medicata Syriaco nardo,'
referring to the Roman practice of mixing spices and persumes with
certain wines. For the ‘ Syrian wares’ cp. Od. 3. 29. 60 ‘ Tyriae
merces.' These would consist of the produce of the East, amongst
them of spices and persumed oils. ‘Assyria nardo] 2. 11. 16; ‘Malo-
bathro Syri0‚⁷ 2. 7. 8.

13. Dis carus ipsis, ‘ I don't envy the trader his wealth, and yet he
surely, if any one, must be a savourite (not, like the Campanian vine-
grower, of Fortune, but) of the gods themselves, else he would have
been drowned long ago on his long voyages.' Under the form of
exalting his εὐδαιμονία Horace hints at¹ the deductions to be made
from it.

15. ‘I do not ask for wealth‚ for Ι am contented with what costs
little,’ ‘dapes inemptae.’ Cp. Epod. 2. 55 soll. and Horace's own
supper, S. 1. 6. 115.

16. leveS‚ ‘light,’ ‘ digestible'; Epod. 2. 58 ‘gravi malvae salubres
corpori.'

17. ‘Be thy boon to me, son of Latona. both in full strength to enjoy
the goods the gods provide me (only, I pray thee, be a sound mind
among them) and to spend an old age neither unhonoured nor unsolaced
by the lyre.'

valido is opposed to ‘ senectam.’ He asks for the health and
strength to enjoy, as long as nature allows a man to look for health
and strength, and when old age comes. for the solaces of old age. This
double purpose of ‘ valido,' fixing the time as well as asking for the
necessary condition of ‘ frui' (⁴ while I am strong and because I am
strong'), will explain the reason why ‘et’ is joined to it, although
grammatically it qualifies ⁶ frui ' and answers to ‘nec (=et non) turpem
senectam degere.’ ⁴ A't‘ has been altered with some slight MS. autho-
rity to ‘ac’ and to ‘et.’ ‘Et valido et integra cum mente,’ which
Orelli accepts, would give a more flowing sentence, and a more com-
plete parallel to Juvenal’s prayer for the ‘mens sana in corpore sano,’
the insertion of ‘precor ' serving only to lay the greater stress on the
second prayer. Bentley, reading ‘ ac‚' seems to divide the sentence into
two prayers, ‘Et frui paratis valido ac senectam degere cum integra
mente, nec turpem, nec cithara carentem.⁷ He quotes Cicero’s descrip-
tion of a happy old age, de Sen. 20 ¹ Vivendi finis est optimus quum
integra mente ceterisque sensibus, opus ipsa suum, eadem quae coag-
mentavit, natura dissolvit.'
