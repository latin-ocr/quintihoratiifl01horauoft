structive.’

ODE XV.

Nereus becalms Paris, as he flies with Helen, to foretell to him his
own fate aud the destruction of Troy.

⁸ Hac ode Bacchylidem imitatum nam ut ille Cassandram facit vati-
cinari sutura belli Troiani ita hic Proteum‚’ Porph. (The last word is
a slip arising from a reminiscence of the prophecies of Proteus in Hom.
Od. 4.) The same statement is repeated by a Scholiast on Stat. Theb.
7. 330. If. however, the fine verses which Cle-ment of Alexandria
quotes, without giving the name of their author (Strom. 5. 731 ὁ Αυρικός
φησι), belonged, as is commonly believed, to this poem, Horace's
imitation cannot have extended beyond the mere sramework.
The lines of Bacchylides are :—
ὧ Τρῶες Ἀρηΐφιλοι, Ζεὺς ὑψιμέδων ὃς ἅπαντα δέρκεται
οὐκ αἴτιος θνατοῖς μεγάλων ἀχέων· ἀλλ’ ἐν μέσῳ κεῖται κιχεῖν
πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποισι Δίκαν ὁσίαν, ἁγνάν,
Εὐνομίας ἀκόλουθον καὶ πινυτᾶς Θέμιδος·
ὀλβίων παῖδές νιν εὑρόντες σύνοικον. (Fr. 29 Bergk.)

The imagery of Horace’s Ode is really Homer's rather than that of
the Greek lyrists, cp. Od. 1. 6.

A Scholiast calls the Ode an allegory of Antony and Cleopatra, and
that explanation of it is adopted by several editors, Landinus, Baxter,
and Sanadon. Ritter draws the parallel out in detail. Paris, hidden
by Venus in Helen's chamber, is Antony taking refuge in Cleopatra's
ship at Actium. etc The whole theory is very improbable. Mitsch.
remarks that the first suggestion of it is probably due to the position of
the Ode. The key which had unlocked the list was applied to this.
Compare the relation of the next two Odes to one another.

The Ode is imitated by Statius, Achill. Ι. 20 foll.

2. Helenen. The older MSS. are divided between ‘ -am‘ and ‘ -en‚'
the majority of later ones are sor the Greek form, see on Od. 1. 1. 34.

perfidus hospitam, ‘his hostess: cp. Od. 3. 3. 26 ‘ famosus hospes.'
The great sting of Paris' offe-nce was that he ᾔσχυνε ξενίαν τράπεζαν
κλοπαῖσι γυναικός, Aesch. Ag. 401. For the relation of the two ad—
