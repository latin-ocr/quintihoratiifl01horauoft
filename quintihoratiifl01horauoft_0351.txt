NOTES. BOOK JJJ, ODE J. 315

37. Minae, the forebodings of his own imagination.

38. scandunt, they can clamber into the villa built out in the water,
by the same entrance as the master.

neque decedit, etc„ the marine villa is lost in the general idea of
the impossibility of flying from care. With the whole stanza cp. 2. 16.
21 foll. and see note there. The reminiscence of Lucretius (2. 47 foll.)
is more evident in this place than in that. ‘Timor et Minae’ recalls
⁴ metus hominum, curaeque sequaces) and in the following stanza we
may hear the echo of ‘ neque fulgorem reverentur ab auro, Nec clarum
vestis splendorem purpureai.'

41. quodsi, etc. The application of the moral professedly to him-
self, really to those whose desires are not as moderate.

dolentem, in body or mind. Cp. Epp. 1. 2. 46 foll. ‘Quod satis est
cui contingit nihil amplius optet. Non domus et fundus non aeris
acervus et auri Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febres Non animo
curas? -

Phrygius lapiS‚ a famous marble‚ white with red spots, brought
from Synnada in Phrygia. Cp. esp. Stat. Silv. 1. 5. 37.

43. usus, like other expressions of the Ode, seems to be due to
Virg. G. 2. 466 ‘Nec casia liquidi corrumpitur usus olivi.² Conington
(in loc.) points out that the two constructions are not exactly parallel.
The ‘ wearing of purple' is the subject of ⁶ delenit ' in sense as well as
grammar3 but the hypallage which makes ‘ sidere clarior⁷ agree with
‘usus’ rather than with ‘purpurarum' (cp. 3. 21. 19 ·iratos regum
apices‚’ and Epod. 10. 12 and 14), is the same as that by which virgil
attributes to the ‘usus olivi’ the adulteration which happened to the
oil itself.

44. Achaemenium, Persian. See on 2. 12. 21.

45. invidendis, 2. 10. 7 ‘caret invidenda Sobrius aula?

novo ritu, ⁵ after the modern fashion.‘ Cp. Od. 2. 15. 10-20, 2. 18.
1-5. The ‘atrium' was the reception room of a great house (cp. Epp.
1. 5. 31 ‘Atria servantem postico falle clientem')‚ and the chief care
was spent on its adornment3 so that the ideas of the two lines will be
exactly parallel to Virg. G. 2. 461—463 ‘ Si non ingentem foribus domus
alta superbis Mane salutantum totis vomit aedibus undam, Nec varios
inhiant pulchra testudine postes.’

47. permutem ; for construction see on 1. 17. 2 ‘Lucretilem mutat
Lycac0.’
