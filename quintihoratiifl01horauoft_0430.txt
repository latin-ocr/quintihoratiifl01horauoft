394 HORA TJJ CARMINA.

Sat. 2. 3. 88 ‘ne sis patruus mihi: and he might have added Od. 2. 11. 4,
‘nec trepides' A slight further anomaly is perhaps found in the close
conjunction of imperative and subjunctive ‘ eripe ’ ⁶ contempleris ἐ but
there is a corresponding shade of difference in tone, the command drops
a little towards advice or entreaty; cp. the changes of mood in 1. 11,
also addressed to a definite person, ‘ ne Quaesieris‚' ‘ sapias‚’ ‘ carpe.’ A
question has been raised whether ‘ semper ’ should be taken with ‘ con-
templeris‚'- ‘be not for ever content to see the fair country view from
your windows’3 or (as Ritter prefers) with ‘udum,‘ ‘Tibur never dry!
the ‘ uda mobilibus pomaria rivis‘ of Ι. 7. 13, ⁴ contempleris’ having in
this case a somewhat stronger force thrown on it: ‘ Don't stay to gaze
at it, come to it.’ The first is the simpler. The places named are all
such as we view from Rome. Missing this obvious sense, Lachmann
altered ‘nec' to ‘hic‚' and others have suggested ‘ut’3 but did they
suppose that Horace had residences at all these places, or that they were
visible from his farm in the Sabine hills, or that he was inviting Maecenas
to a tour about Latium?

Aefulae. evidently on the slopes of the hills near Tibur: its exact
position is not known. It has been identified with Monte Affliano, two
miles S. E. of Tivoli. Livy (26. 9) names the ⁶ arx Aefulae' as one of
the strongholds garrisoned on the approach of Hannibal; and Pliny
(3. 9) mentions it as one of the cities of Latium which had ceased to
exist before his time. There is a doubt as to the form between Aefula
and Aesula.

8. Telegoni iuga: Epod. 1. 29 ‘ Tusculi Circaea moenia.‘ Legends
assigned its foundation to Telegonus. the son of Ulysses by Circe, who
unwittingly slew his father. Arist. Poet. 14.

9. fastidiosam, act. which causes ‘ fastidium) ‘ which tires.'

10. molem; cp. 2. 15. 1 ‘regiae moles.’ Perhaps the ‘domus alta'
(Epod. 9. 3) of Maecenas on the Esquiline. Conington, quoting as
parallel Virg. Aen. 1. 421 ‘ Miratur molem Aeneas magalia quondam,
Miratur portas strepitumque et strata viarum‚’ prefers to take ‘ molem'
of the buildings of Rome generally,

1 1. beatae, ὀλβίας ; cp. 1. 4. 14. Osten used, as here, for a happiness
vouched for by public opinion, rather than by the speaker. Cp. Sat.
2. 8. 1 ‘ Ut Nasidieni iuvit te coena beati ⁷?

12. fumum et-opes strepitumque, the elements which, Horace
would say, make up that ‘ happiness’ of Rome which as a whole
Maecenas is supposed to admire. The point is the mixture of magnifi-
cence and annoyance; but Horace, as he indicates by the collocation.
would count the magnificence among the annoyances. For ‘ strepitum’
cp. Epp. 2. 2. 72 foll.

13. vices, a change of life.
