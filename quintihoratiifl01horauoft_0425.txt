NOTES. BOOKJH, ODE XXVII. 389

27. medias fraudes. She did not discover the ‹leception till she was
in the thick of it (ἐν μέσοις ἀρκυστάτοις), and then she ‘turned pale at
the sight, for all her boldness.'

28. palluit, with accusative, as in Epp. 1. 3. 10.

30. debitam i. 36. 2, 2. 7. 17.

33. centum oppidis; Epod. 9. 29. The Homeric ἑκατόμπολιν, 11.
2. 649.

34. Pater, o relictum filiae nomen, ‘My father! oh name thy
daughter may no longer speak’ It is probably best to take the words
‘Paterl o nomen (se. patris) filiae (sc. a filia) relictum.’ She calls on
her father, but the name reminds her that she has lest behind her the
privileges as well as the duties recalled by it. Bentley compares
Ariadne’s confession, Ov. Her. 10. 69 ‘Nam pater et tellus iusto regnata
parenti Prodita sunt facto nomina cara meo.’ The other possible con-
struction, ‘filiae (gen. case) nomen relictum (sc. a me)‚⁷ seems, as Bentley
argues, to require ‘O pater! O relictum‚' etc„ as they then become
separate exclamations.

Europa’s father was, according to Homer, ΙΙ. 14. 321, Phoenix; ae-
cording to Ovid, Met. 1. c., Agenor.

35. pietas victa furore; ep. Ov. Met. 1. 149 ‘Victa iacet pietas.'
This is better than, with Acron, to take ‘ victa furore’ with ‘dixit,‘ as a
description of Europa.

37. unde quo. The two questions run together after the Greek

’ fashion, τίς πόθεν γε’γὼη Eur. Ale. 213. ‘Asyndeton convenit com-

 

 

 

moto loquentis animo,' Ritter. Mitsch. compares Virgil’s expression
of Turnus' bewilderment, Aen. 10. 669 ‘Quo feror? unde abii? quae
me fuga quemve reducet?’ This is perhaps consistent with the feeling

j that if she answered her questions, the answer would be, ‘from a happy

home to shame and danger ' ; but in the first instance the picture seems

, to be of bewilderment, expressed by a rapid succession of contradictory

thoughts, though they settle down at last into sels-reproach.

una mors, ‘a single death⁷=death by itself‚ without additional
pains. Soph. Ant. 308 οὐχ ὑμῖν ’Ἅιδης μοῦνος ἀρκέσει. Propertius
imitates it, 5. 4. 17 ‘Et satis una malae poterit mors esse puellae';
Paley, in loc„ refers the expression to the Greek πολλάκις, μυριάκις,
τεθνάναι.

, levis, ‘is light for,’ i.e. ‘a light punishment for.’

38. virginum culpae. Orelli points out (against Markland, who
wished to read ‘virginis’) that the plural softens, by generalising‚ the
truth. She feels the special application, but is likely to shrink from
expressing it. Similarly, Bentley injures the delicacy of the passage by
changing ‘vitiis’ to ‘vitio.' The reasons which he gives sor the
change—the generality of the plural and the technical use of the
