NOTES. BOOKJ‚ ODE X. 189

27. virenti, Od. 4. 13. 6 ‘virentis Chiae'3 Epod. 13. 4 ‘dumque
virent genua' ; so a hale old age is called ‘ viridis senectus?

constituebat amicae.'

21 soll. ‘ Now too the sweet tell-tale laugh from the secret corner
that betrays the hiding girl’; ‘repetatur’ is understood from the last
sentence. Compare the lover's play in Virg. E. 3. 63 ‘ Et sugit ad
salices et se cupit ante videri.’ Dillenburger calls attention to the
symmetrical arrangement of the adjectives and their substantives:
‘latentis puellae‚‘ ‘proditor risus‚' ‘intimo angulo'; ‘puellae' seems
to depend ἀπὸ κοινοῦ on ⁴ proditor’ and ⁶ risus.'

24. male pertinaci. This may mean either ‘but faintly resisting’
or ‘wickedly (i. e. coquettishly) resisting‚’ resisting in order to invite
the violence.

Gr ek.

{Iercuriuffl identified with the Greek Hermes, is celebrated as the
teacher of language3 of the palaestra; of the lyre; of craft, theft in-

Compare Ovid, Fast. 5. 663-692 ‘ Clare nepos Atlantis‚' etc.

Line 1. facunde, λόγιος is a frequent epithet of Hermes3 so he is
the mouthpiece of the gods, ⁵ interpres Divom.’

nepos, as the son of Maia ¹ quam Atlas generat‚’ Virg. Aen. 8. 141.

word meaning properly ² sharp.'
