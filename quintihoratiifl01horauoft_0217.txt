NOTES. BOOKI, ODE VJ. 181

alite’ as an abl. absol„ a construction the use of which Horace is
inclined to extend (see Od. 2. 1. 12, 16, 2. 7. 15, 3. 5. 5). The position
of the words is quite in his manner ; the promise or permission standing
first, and accompanied only by Varius’ name as a sufficient guarantee
to stay in initio any impatience; then, measured off against each other,
the characteristics of the theme and of the poet who is fit to sing of it.

⁴ ¹ It shall be told, but by Varius, thy bravery and thy victories, for he is

a bird of Maeoniam song.' For the grammatical difficulty of the sepa-
ration os ‘ Vario' from ‘alite'we may perhaps compare Sat. 1. 3. 70
‘ Cum mea compenset vitiis bona,' if ‘ cum’ be there a preposition. For
more certain but rather less analogous cases of odd sorting of words see
Sat. 1. 5. 72; 2.1.60; 2. 3. 211. The passages usually quoted on this place,
such as (of Horace) Sat. 2. 1. 84 ‘Iudice laudatus Caesare'3 Epp. 1. 1.
94 ‘curatus inaequali tonsore‚’ are insufficient ‘to substantiate the use
of the ablative of the agent without a preposition. There is·either a
predicate present, as in ‘iudice Caesare' (Dillenburger quotes it as
‘ laudatus Caesare] which would be just the case we are in search of).
which brings it within the scope of the abl. absol„ or else the subst. is
barely personal, and the abl. becomes rather instrumental or modal,
as in Ov. Met. 7. 50 ‘matrum celebrabere turba.‘ Ov. Her. 12. 161
⁴ Deseror coniuge‚' may be explained perhaps as following such analo-
gies as ‘ orbor,' ⁴ viduor ¹.' The alteration ⁶ aliti' is easy, too much so
to be probable. For ‘ales' as the title of a poet, cp. Od. 4. 2. 25
‘ Dircaeum cycnum‚' and the whole idea of Od. 2. 20.

3. quam rem cunque, ‘ every exploit which thy brave soldiery
achieved by sea or land, led on by thee' ; the construction is as if the
previous clause had run ‘scribentur fortitudo et victoriae tuae.’ The
tmesis is common in Horace, cp. Od. 1. 7. 25, and even in prose, Cic.
pro Sest. 31 ‘ quod iudicium cunque subierat.'

5. neque . . nec, ‘we essay no more to tell thistale than to tell,’
etc„ cp. Od. 3. 5. 27.

6. stomachum. This rendering of the Homerie μῆνιν οὐλομένην is
quoted by Charisius as an instance of intentional ταπείνωσις, which he
defines ‘rei magnae humilis expositio,' as if it were an undignified word
chosen to show Horace’s distaste sor such a character. In any case, in
respect of this as well as of ‘ duplicis’ and ‘ saevam‚’ though the traits
themselves are traditional‚ their selection is probably intended to point
a contrast with the milder themes which Horace prefers. ‘I cannot
write of the fierceness and the craft and the cruelty of heroic wars’

7. duplicis, πολύτροπος, Hom.; διπλοῦς ἀνὴρ, Eur. Rhes. 193.

¹ This was written before the publication of the 2nd ed. of Prof. Mayor's Juvenal.

The note which he inserts‚by Mr. Η. Α. J Munro, on Sat. r. 13, argues my rnain
point more effectively than Ι can.
