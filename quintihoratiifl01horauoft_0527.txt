NOTES. EPODE XVII. 491

have ‘luxere ' ; but, besides the preponderance of MS. authority,
‘ unxere ’ answers better to ⁴ addictum alitibus ἐ it expresses more defi-
nitely the fact which is the real point, viz. that they recovered the body,
though Achilles had declared that they should not have it. ‘Luxere'
would at least involve an ambiguity, even if it admits, as Bentley argues,
the sense of formal mourning over the body.

addictum; Il. 23. 182 “Europa δ’ οὔτι Δώσω Πριαμίδην πυρὶ δαπτέμεν,
ἀλλὰ κύνεσσιν.

12. homicidam, a translation of ἀνδροφόνος, Hector’s epithet in Il. 1.
242 and elsewhere.

¹3· Hom. Il. 24. 510, os Priam before Achilles, κλαῖ’ ἀδινὰ προπάροιθε
ποδῶν Ἀχιλῆος ἐλυσθείς.

14. heu pervicacis3 Od. 1. 6. 6 ί cedere nescii.’ The exclamation
emphasizes the epithet: ‘We reprobate obstinacy even in him, yet he
yielded.’ Orelli takes it rather as referring to the whole sentence ‘ ad
indignitatem facti,' to the thought of Priarn ‘holding the knees and
kissing the hands,’ δεινὰς ἀνδροφόνους αἵ οἱ πολέας κτάνον υἷας.

15-18. Ritter points out that the last place is reserved for Circe, as
coming nearer home to the witch Canidia.

15. The construction is ‘membra setosa pellibus,‘ i.e. the shapes of
swine‚ ‘with bristles on their hard hides’

16. laboriosi, genitive case; Epod. 16. 60. It is a translation of
πολύτλας, πολυτλήμων.

17. Circa. Some good MSS. read ‘Circe'; but the other form is
sufficiently established by the express statement of val. Probus, 2. 1.
16 (a grammarian of uncertain date, but considerably earlier than any
existing MS. of Horace), who, speaking of substantives from the Greek
in e, sayS, that as there is no ablative in Greek, they take in the ablative
the Latin a, ‘ unde est illud Horatii Volente Circa?

sonus, the power of speech.

18. h0n0r; Virg. Aen. 1. 591, ‘beauty,’ ‘dignity.‘

20. muitum, with adjective, Od.‘ Ι. 25. 5 ‘multum facilis.'

institoribus; on Od. 3. 6ἶ 50.

21. verecundus color, the blush os health.

22. ossa. Bentley, followed by Haupt and Meineke, would alter the
unanimous reading of the MSS. to ‘ora,' objecting to the expression
‘ossa reliquit color? But! ‘ossa atque pellis ' were as habitual a con-
junction as our ⁶ skin and bones.' Plaut. Aul. 3. 6. 28 ‘ ossa atque pellis
totus est, ita cura macet,’ and ‘ ossa pelle amicta’ is equivalent to ⁶ pel—
lem ossa amicientem.'

pelle, not used of the human skin in life and health3 see F ore„ s. v.
‘ cutis,’ and cp. Juv. 10. 192 ‘deformem pro cute pellem.’
