382 ΗΘΚΛ TII CARMINA.

words need not imply more than that Horace already imagines the

triumphal procession in which, arnid the popular joy, the mischievous . 'i‘

gold will be conducted to the capitol. Its destination was probably
suggested by the gifts which Augustus had made, or was about to make,
to that temple. Suet. Aug. 30 ‘in cellam Capitolini lovis sedecim millia
pondo auri gemmasque ac margaritas quingenties H. S. una donatione
contulit.' Cp. generally Od. 3. 3. 49—52.

48. gemmas et lapides. For the same distinction the editors quote
Ov. de Med. Fac. 20, 21 ‘Conspicuam gemmis vultis habere manum:
Induitis collo lapides oriente petitos‘; Mart. 11. 50. 4 ‘ Gemma vel a
digito vel cadit aure lapis.’ One might fancy from these lines that
‘gemma’ meant specially a stone set and graven; and passages are
quoted in which ‘lapis’ is used specially of a pearl. In any case
the double substantive will mean ‘jewels of every kind‘; see above,
v. 12.

49. summi mali, ‘ dictum ut summa respublica, summa salus,’ Orelli,
‘ the occasion of the chief ofsending.'

50. bene=‘vere‚’ ‘to any good purpose.’ Cp. the uses of ‘male,'
⁵ male sanus‚’ etc.

51. eradenda. . elementa. If any full metaphor is felt, it would
seem to be of rubbing out the characters on a waxed tablet. The
στοιχεῖα, rudiments‚ alphabet, of avarice must be effaced, the mind must
become once more καθαρὸς πίναξ,

cupidinis, maso, see on 2. 16. 15 ; here, as there, it is the desire of
money.

54. rudis, with ‘nescit ' 3 it is antithetieal to ⁶ doctior ’ ; ‘knows not,
sor he has never been taught this lesson.'

57. Graeco. For the comparison of true Roman sports to the more
fashionable Greek ones cp. Sat. 2. 2. 9 foll. ‘leporem sectatus equove
Lassus ab indomito vel si Romana fatigat Militia assuetum Graecari,
seu pila velox . . Seu te discus aget‚' etc. The ‘trochus ’ was a hoop;
see Dict. Ant.

58. vetita legibus; Ov. Trist. 2. 470 ‘ Haec [alea] est ad nostros
non leve crimen avos ‘; Cic. Phil. 2. ²3 ‘Licinium Denticulam de alea
condemnatum? The definite laws are not known.

59. cum . .fa11at, seems to give the reason of the foregoing facts.
You cannot wonder at it when the father himself is engaged as he is.

periura fides3 cp. 1. 18. 16 ‘Arcani fides prodigas You trust his
honour, you find it forsworn.

60. consortem socium, ‘the partner of his fortunes? ‘ Consors'
was used for a ‘coheir,’ as ‘sors' for ‘patrimonium' Fest. s. v. It
seems to be more widely used for those whose fortune is in the same

bottom.
