326 HORATII CARMINA.

choice given to Cli0(1. 1 2. 25, ‘lyra vel acri [cp. ‘ acuta voce ’] Tibia ' ; and
the two kinds of accompaniment for lyric poetry are common in Horace,
as in Od. 1. 1. 32, where they are assigned respectively to Polyhymnia
and Euterpe. Cp. also 4. 1. 22.

2. longum, ‘sustained.’ He is preparing for a longer effort than
usual ; ‘ maius opus movet.'

Calliope, see on 1. 1. 323 she is called ‘regina’ as agoddess‚ as
ἄνασσα, πότνια in Greek. The repetition of the vocative, and the separa-
tion which gives greater emphasis to each utterance of it, are intended
to mark the earnestness of his appeal.

4. fidibus citharave. If, with the great majority of the MSS„ we
retain ‘ve,' we must take ‘ fidibus' of the lyra. Such expressions as
λύρῃ κιθαρίζειν (Hom. Hymn. ad Merc. 473) show that in early times
the two names belonged to the same instrument, but they were sub-
sequently distinguished. The ‘ citha1·a‚' whose invention was ascribed
to Apollo, was like a modern guitar, its strings stretched over the
sounding body; the ‘lyra,’¹ which remained the property of Hermes
(Epod. 13. 9 ‘ fide Cyllenea ¹), had its strings open on both sides like a
harp. Bentley, and most subsequent editors, have altered ‘ ve' to ‘ que,'
so that ‘fidibus citharaque' will be=‘fidibus citharae.’ Cp. Virg-
Aen. 6. 120 ‘Threicia cithara fidibusque canoris.’

5. ‘ Is it a real sound that others too can hear, or is it a “fine fancy ’‘
of mine? ’

amabilis insania, an oxymoron ; madness, but one os which I should
not wish to be enred. Horace claims the ἐνθουσιασμός, μανία gPlat.
Phaedr. p. 245 A) of a poet.

6. pios lucos, not, as Acron interpreted it, of Elysium, but of the
woods which the Muses haunt: Μουσῶν νάπαι, Plat. Ion, p. 534 A. Cp.
Od. 1.1.30, 3. 25. 2, 4. 2. 50, 4.3.10. ‘ Pios' either: ‘saerOS‚’ ‘ haunted
by god5‚’ or because the ‘profanum vulgus’ is excluded from them,
3. 1. 1 soll.

9. me fabulosae. The emphasis on ‘ me ’ points out the connection
with the preceding stanzas, ‘no wonder that Ι should hear the Muses'
voice, though you do not. I have been their favourite from my baby-
hood?

fabulosae, ‘legendary.' ‘De quibus fabulantur poetae.’ They are
the birds of Venus that draw her car; they carry ambrosia to Zeus
himself (Hom. Od. 12. 62). The suggestion is that their aetion in
covering the child-poet in leaves was, like their actions of which legends
tell, ‘non sine Dis¹; and, as Conington remarks, the emphatic con-
junction ‘me fabulosae,' etc. is as much as to say, ‘ Ι, too, like other
poets (as Stesichorus, Pindar, Aeschylus), have a legend of my infancy.’
