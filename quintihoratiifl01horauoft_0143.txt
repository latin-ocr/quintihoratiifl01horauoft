directed to the similar object of obtaining military command
of the more eastern passes into the valleys of the Rhine and
the Inn, which were still unsafe sor the armies of Rome or her
allies, and from which the mountain—tribes even issued from
time to time to plunder Italian soil. Drusus forced what is
now known as the Brenner pass, meeting and overthrowing the
Rhaetians in the valley near Tridentum, now Trent. In the
meantime, or as soon as Drusus' success was assured, Tiberius
was detached from Augustus' army in Gaul, with the purpose
of taking the enemy in the rear. He ascended the Rhine
valley to the Lake of Constance, where he launched a flotilla
of boats‚ and entering at once several of the valleys which open
on the lake, ‘penetrated the gorges of the Upper Rhine and
Inn in every direction, so that at the conclusion of a brilliant
and rapid campaign, the two brothers had effected the complete
subjugation of the country of the Grisons and the Tyrol.' ‘The
free tribes of the Eastern Alps appear then for the first time
in history, only to disappear again for a thousand years.'
