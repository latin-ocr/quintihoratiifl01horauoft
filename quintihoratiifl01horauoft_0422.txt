weapon for the purpose, and, as Bentley complains, the ‘oppositae
fores' would have protected the porter. He alters ‘et arcus' boldly
to ‘securesque ’; Keller adopts the rather strange conjecture ‘ascias,'
a rare word for an axe. Other meanings have been suggested for ‘arcus,’
such as ‘ catapults ' or ‘levers‚' but they are unsupported.

9, 10. It is common to preface prayers by recalling various titles
and sacred places of the god who is addressed. ‘Cyprus’ is the
well-known seat of Venus* worship; see 1. 3. 1. Why ‘Memphis’ is
named is not so clear. Hdt. (2. 112) and Strabo (17, p. 1161) mention
a temple of Ἀφροδιτὴ ξεινή there. A line of Bacchylides (37, Bergk)
has been preserved: τὴν ἀχείμαντόν τε Μέμφιν καὶ δονακώδεα Νεῖλον, of
which possibly an echo is heard in the epithet of Memphis here; but
the connection of the verse is not known. Probably, as Dillr. and Ritter
think, ‘carentem nive’ is an appeal to Venus against the icy heart of
Chloe: ‘Etenim frigus ut in rerum natura ita in hominum pectoribus
odiosum est Veneri] Dillr.

ODE XXVII.

‘Evil omens are for the evil. 1s1 sear for you, Ι will at least wish
you all good omens⁴ Go, if you must go, and be happy wherever you
are; and think of me sometimes, Galatea. Only remember the season.

1t 15 ,possible that the conclusion of Europa's story loses its im-
medffite point from our not knowing the circumstances of Galatea’s
journey. &Vas she too, as has been suggested, to find consolation in
the wealth and greatness of the eompanion of her travel? There is no
passion, though there is tenderness and kindliness, in the poet's feeling
towards her. The Ode contrasts in this respect with the similar poems
of Propertius (1. 8) and Oxid (Am 2.11).

In any case Horace meant people to read his Ode who knew nothing
of Galatea, and the story of Europa makes an artistic w,hole even if, as

is so osten the case in Pindar' s mythologieal episodes, it only touches ζ

at one point the subject with which the Ode begins, The story of ¹

Europa is told in Ov. Met. 2. 847 soll.
