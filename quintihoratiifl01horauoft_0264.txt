ODE XXVIII.

If it be essential to good drama that the dramatic play should be at
least so obvious that most intelligent readers should put the same in—
terpretation upon it, this Ode cannot be pronounced very successful.
Its scene, its nature, the division of the parts (if it is a dialogue), its
purpose, are all points on which it would be hard to find two editors
who agree.

The question of the scene has been complicated by doubts which
have been raised as to thc locality of the ‘Matinum litus? The
Scholiasts speak with an uncertain voice. ‘Mons Apuliae, sive ut
quidam volunt plana Calabriae’ is Acron’s note. Porph. calls it here
‘promontorium Apuliae ' ; on Epod. 16. 28 ‘Mons Calabriae.’ Ritter,
arguing from this Ode, and pressing the identity of the ‘Matina apis'
of Od. 4. 2. 27 with the ‘ Calabrae apes ' of 3. 16. 33, and the Tarentine
bees of 2. 6. 14, places it near Tarentum, where it was natural that
Archytas should have been buried. The balance of evidence, however,
is greatly in favour of the more northern site. The ‘ Matina cacumina ’
of Epod. 16. 28 would seem to have been part of the range of Mount
Garganus, and the ‘litus Matinum ’ the shore at their base. A village
and port at this place is still called ⁴ Mattinata.’ Lucan, 9. 182,j0ins
Vultur, Garganus, and ‘calidi buxeta Matini,' as all belonging to
Apulia. The Scholiasts' confusion arose more probably from the
vagueness with which the term ‘Calabria' was employed in many
writers. We must choose then sor the scene of the Ode between the
‘litus Matinuin,⁷ as thus explained, and the shore near Tarentum.
Which is most likely, that a speaker on the shore of Apulia should
commend a passing sailor to the care of ‘Neptune, the warder of sacred
Tarentum,’ or that one speaking at Tarentum shall apostrophize Ar-
chytas in his burial place on the ‘litus Matinum ³? The question seems
to be really settled by the second local reference in v. 26. The woods
about Venusia are near enough to stand for the ‘inland woods ’ on the
shore just north of the Aufidus, but they would not occur naturally if
the scene were at Tarentum.

The Ode consists of at least two parts; some moralizing on the
universality of Deam, connected in some way with the fate of Archytas,
and the petition of an unburied corpse for the handful of sand which
would enable it to cross the Styx. What is the relation between the
two? The oldest answer was that the unburied body was that os
Archytas himself, who (we must suppose) had been drowned and cast
ashore during a voyage on the Adriatic. The Scholiasts consider the Ode
a monologue, the shade of Archytas addressing itself in the first twenty
