17. impiae; 4. 4. 46 ‘impio Poenorum tumultu?

20. Calabrae Pierides, from Rudiae, a village of South Calabria,
the birthplaee of Ennius.’

21. chartae sileant; cp. 4. 9. 31.

22 soll. Instances from mythology of the immortalising power of
poetry——Romulus‚ Aeacus, Hercules, the Tyndaridae, Bacchus.

22. Iliae Mavortisque puer, i. e. despite his royal and divine
aneestry.

23. taciturnitas invida; cp. 4. 9. 33 ‘lividas obliviones? Verses
are quoted from Ennius in honour of Romulus; but the thought is not
limited to any particular poem. ‘Rome itself, with all its greatness
and history, would not tell us who Romulus was unless poetry kept the
legend alive.’

26. virtus et favor, generally taken of the poet’s power and good
will ; but it is perhaps better to take thern of Aeaeus ι ‘ His virtue and
his popularity, and the poet's tongue.’ ‘ Et . . et’ will imply that the
last condition is at least as necessary as the other two; its position and

for the meaning, such as it is, of the doctrine, see there in note on
v. 12.

29. sie, by the power of poetry.

30. optatis, ‘he has attained his wishes. ‘Enisus arces attigit
igneas.'

31. Cp. 1. 3. 2, 1.12. 27.

33. This line has been suspected on account of its similarity to 3. 25.
20 ‘Cingentem viridi tempora pampin0'; but ‘Liber’ (as Orelli re-
marks) would stand badly with no qualifying clause. It means ‘ as a
g0d‚' ‘in the insignia by which we always recognise him)

ODE IX.

⁶ Do not despise the office of the lyric poet, Lollius. Pindar's poems
live, unextinguished by Homer's greater name; and so do those of
Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho. Before Homer
