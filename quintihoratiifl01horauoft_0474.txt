438 HORA Τί] CARMINA.

D'oring, who also takes this view, points out that the images of the first =
three stanzas have a special appropriateness as addressed to a poet, and
the poet of the Bucolics and Georgics. The chief difficulties in the “-
way of the theory, apart from the absence of any tradition on the sub- ξι
ject (for the Scholiasts all imagine some other Virgilius to be intended), ζ
lie in expressions os v. 15 ‘iuvenum nobilium cliens,‘ and v. 25 ‘ studium ³

lucri.' Of course these can be disposed of as covering meanings to ³

which we have lost the key; but it is rather hard to imagine any
possible meaningS. ‘ Pone moras et studium lueri‚’ is exactly the style ,
in which Horace would address one of his ordinary friends engaged in
the common pursuits os the day; but what can it mean addressed to
Virgil? We cannot really refer it to the proposed exchange of wine for
nard, and take it to mean, ‘ Don't haggle about the bargain.' ‘ Iuvenum

nobilium cliens,' again, is natural enough and complimentary enough, x
when some special ‘iuvenes nobiles,’ as Drusus and Tiberius, are in
Horace's poetical favour, when the fact of the dependeney is notorious,
and the point is the nobilsty, in the best sense, of the patrons; but at
what period of Virgil's life could it have sounded like a compliment?
Macleane is content with the Scholiast’s suggestion that Augustus and
Maecenas are the ‘iuvenes'; but he can scarcely have really thought
that the possibility of such an expression was proved by Horace's calling Ἰ
Augustus ‘iuvenis’ in r. 2. 41. There is, perhapS, a small indication
that the Ode was written near the same time as the last, in the parallel
expressions ‘ Ut tamen noris quibus advoceris Gaudiis,' 1 1. 13, ‘Ad quae
si properas gaudia,' 12. 21. The use of ‘gaudia' is suffieiently unusual ,

to be noticeable‚ and to occur to a writer's mind a second time, but less i

likely to have been repeated at a distance of time. The Scholiasts and j
inscriptions of MSS. call Virgilius ‘unguentarius,' ‘mercator,’ ‘nego- ¹

tiator‚' ‘medicus Neronum) All look as if they were inserences more ¹

or less clumsy from words of the Ode itself; but the general impres· Ῐ
sion, in spite of the temptation to identify him with the only well-known
Virgilius, that he was a different and later person, is of some value. ’

The substance of the Ode is very parallel to one of Catullus (13), in
which he bids Fabullus come to supper, and bring with him all the
materials save the unguent, which he will supply himself, and which he
promises shall be so delicious that Fabullus will wish that he were all
nose.
