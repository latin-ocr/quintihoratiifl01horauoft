NOTES. EPODE XI. 481

‘acri Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor, Et simul incussit
suavem mi in pectus amorem Musarum,' coloured perhaps by Virgil's
imitation, G. 2. 476 ⁵ ingenti percussus amore '; so that ‘ amore‚’ made
emphatic by its repetition, and explained iu V. 4, has the force osa
‘ passion, vehement and irresistible, but not sor the Muses?

3. expetit urere, sor the prose ‘ quem urat.’

6. honorem decutit, Od. 1. 17. 16 ‘Ruris honorum,’ Virg. G. 2.
404 ⁴ Frigidus et silvis Aquilo decussit honorem‚’ see Conington’s note
there. Servius says that that line is borrowed from Varro Atacinus;
if so, Horace may have taken it from the same source.

7. nam pudet, the reason sor his exclaiming ‘heu me‚' etc., not sor
the fact which he states in his exclamation.

8. fabula, ‘ a topic oftalk‚' Epp. Ι. 13. 9.

10. arguit, the perfect tense.

11. contrane . .valere‚ Madv. ξ 399, Virg. Aen. 1. 39 ‘Mene in-
cepto desistere victam,’ and so too Cicero, Rosc. Am. 14 ‘Tene tibi
partes istas depoposcisse?’ It expresses surprise and indignation.

12. applorans, ‘wailing with some one to listen.' The word only
occurs here and once in Seneca.

13. calentis, the genitive depends on ‘areana‚⁷ ‘had stirred from their
concealment my secrets as Ι grew warrn with stronger wine.'

inverecundus, ‘ destroying bashfulness?

15—18. This is a continuation of Horace's own speech, begun in v. 1 1.
‘ well, if only she angers me a little more you shall hear nothing further
of these complaints. I will give up a struggle with rivals who are not
worthy of me.'

16. libera bilis, ‘Iiberrima indignati0,’ Epod. 4. 10. ‘If my anger
once boil up and find vent.'

17. fomenta, ‘useless bandages which give no ease to the aching
wound,’ i.e. such complaints as he has been uttering. The case requires
more trenchant treatment. It is a τομῶν πῆμα (Soph. Aj. 582).

18. ‘My modesty will vanish; I shall rate mysels at my true worth,
and refuse to continue a contest with rivals who are so far below me?

19. -severus, ‘ as one who would not relent.'

laudaveram, ‘when Ι had boasted of these resolutions,' told them
as something Ι was proud of.

20. iussus, You bade me go horne, and think no more of her, but
my feet could not keep the purpose, but went back to Inachia's door.
Cp. Tibull. 2. 6. 11 ‘Magna loquor: sed magnifice mihi magna locuto
Excutiunt clausae fortia verba fores. Iuravi quoties rediturum ad limina
nunquam Cum bene iuravi pes tamen ipse redit.’

22. Compare Od. 3.Δ 10. 2 ‘ asperas Porrectum ante fores‚' etc.

26. libera, ‘for all their plainness?
