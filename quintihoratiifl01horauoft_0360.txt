quarter fiery beat revels unchecked, in what quarter the mists and dews
of rain.’ The great majority of MSS. read ⁸ tanget’ as against the vulg.
⁴ tangat'3 and there is some force in Juno’s grudging assent passing into
a distinct prophecy (cp. ¹ fata dieo,' v. 57) of Rome’s greatness, provided
only as before that her condition is observed.

54. visere, of seeing as a sight. Cp. Od. 2. 15. 3.

55. debacchentur, see on ‘ decertantem‚' 1. 3. 13. For the descrip-
tion of the torrid and frigid zones cp. 1. 22. 17 foll„ and Virg. G. 1.
234—236 ‘una corusco Semper sole rubens et torrida semper ab igni,
Quam circum extremae dextra laevaque trahuntur Caerulea glacie con-
cretae atque imbribus atris.'

57. bellicosis, ‘ they will seek empire by arms3 the destiny which 1
have announced is theirs on this condition?

58. pii . . fidentes, two motives may induce them to forget her
warning; filial feeling towards their μητρόπολις, overweening confidence
in their own powers.

61. alite lugubri = ⁶ malis auspiciis'; 1. 15. 5 ‘mala avi,’ 4. 6. 23
‘potiore alite.’

62. iterabitur, ‘the fortunes of Troy, if in an evil hour it is called to
life again, shall be repeated in an overthrow as sad as before! The
hypallage whereby ‘ renascens’ is made to agree with Troy's fortunes
rather than with Troy helps in point of feeling to make it more clear
that any new life of the city would be but the old life repeated, and
would end in the same catastrophe; in point of grammar it leaves
‘iterabitur ’ without any proper subject, for it is the past destiny which
can properly be said to be repeated, not the one which is reopened.

63. victrices, victorious before and to be victorious again.

64. Virg. Aen. 1. 46 ⁶ Iovis . . Et soror et conjux: Hom. Il. 16. 432.

66. auctore Phoebo. A few MSS. read ‘ duetore,' which might be
paralleled by ‘potiore ductos Alite muros‚' 4. 6. 23, but the vulg. is
amply supported by Virg. G. 3. 36 ‘Troiae Cynthius auctor.‘ The
expression might have been used to mean merely ⁶ with the advice of
Phoebus‚’ but it doubtless refers to the legend that Apollo himself built
the walls of Troy; cp. Propert. 4. 6. 43 ⁶ murorum Romulus auctor?

meis Argivis, Argos being a chief seat os Juno's worship, 1. 7. 8.

67. uxor . . virum puerOS‚ the men slain, the women sold to
slavery.
