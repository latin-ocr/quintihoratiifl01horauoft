ODE Ι.

‘Hear the ‘reaching os the Muses, ye that are fit to receive it. All
human greatness is bounded. Kings are above υς, but jove is above
kings; men may differ in wealth and rank, but Death makes no dis-

a pang. Do not ask me, then, to change my happy Sabine valley for a
palace that will only bring on me envy, and wealth that only increases
trouble.'

The exordium suits the beginning of a Book, and also indicates that
the Ode or Odes which follow have some special dignity. The sequence

ject, is by itself sufficiently different srorn the poet's usual practice to
attract remark. Diomedes, in his account of Horace's metres, treats
them as one continuous poem, numbering Ode 7 as 2; and both MSS.
and Scholiasts are inclined to press, beyond the bounds of probability,
the connection between one Ode and another (see Introd. to Ode 3, and
note on 4. 1). The unity, however, of general purpose is obvious. The
ends social, moral, religions, political, which a good government would
set before itself in Rome are reviewed, and it is more than once pro-
mised that Caesar’s rergime is to compass them. The Odes fall by their
