428 ΗΘΚΛ Tll CARMINA.

6. Parrhasius, a painter of Ephesus, a contemporary of Zeuxis, and
therefore living about the time of the Peloponnesian war. Xenophon
describes Socrates as paying a visit to his studio. Quintilian (12.
10. 5) calls him ‘ legumlatorem ’ in the art of painting, and Pliny (N. H.
35. 36) praises him as the first who ‘symmetriam picturae dedit.’

Scopas, of Paros, belongs to the first half of the 4th century B.C.‚
being an elder contemporary of Praxiteles, and with him at the head of
the ‘later Attic school' of sculpture, which is distinguished from the
earlier school, of which Phidias was the representative.

8. ponere, to ‘represent,' properly of sculpture; to set up, to leave
standing before you. Cp. A. P. 36 ‘ Infelix operis summae, quia ponere
totum Nesciet,' Od. 4. 1. 20 ‘ponet marmoream,' Virg. E. 3. 46, and
the correlative ‘stare,y Sat. 2. 3. 183 ‘ aeneus ut stes‘ It is transferred
to poetieal representation Juv. 1. 155 ‘ Pone Tigellinum.'

9. haee vis, either=‘facultas‚' sc. ‘donandi talia‚' but it is hard to
parallel the use, or: ‘ harum deliciarum copia‚' as ‘hederae vis‚’ 4. 11. 4.

nee is the reading of V against the more common ‘non.'

10. res . .animus, you are too rich to want such dainty presents,
too simple in your tastes to care sor them.

12. pretium dicere muneri, i.e. tell you how much it is worth.
The construction as in Sat. 2. 3. 23 ‘ Callidus huic signo ponebam milia
centum,' Ter. Hecyra Prol. 41 ‘si nunquam avare pretium statui arti
meae.’ The remainder of the Ode is occupied in setting its value on
the gift, i.e. in setting forth the ‘deathless powers’ that ‘to verse
belong.'

13. notis publicis, inscriptions graven by order of the State. There
seems to be an allusion to an act of Augustus (Suet. Aug. 31), who had
erected in his Forum statues of the great generals of the Republic‚
with laudatory inscriptions.

13—20. The general meaning of these lines is clear, though the
literature which they have occasioned is a sufficient proof that their
expression is somewhat confused. ‘No other record of great deeds,
such as statues and inscriptions (which may be destroyed and ob-
literated), not the great (leeds themselves &which may be forgotten)‚ can
confer immortality of fame as poetry can? The expression begins
generally as if he were going to talk of all great generals; the second
clause narrows it to Scipio Africanus Major. The chief difficulty lies
in v. 17. Attempts have been made to explain that verse of the
burning of the camp of Syphax by the elder Scipio, Liv. 30. 5, or the
burning os the Carthaginian ships surrendered at the end of the Second
Punic war, ‘quarum conspectum repente incendium [tradunt] tam
lugubre fuisse Poenis quam si tum ipsa Carthago arde1·et.' Liv. 30. 43;
and if Ennius himself had used such a phrase, we might have explained
