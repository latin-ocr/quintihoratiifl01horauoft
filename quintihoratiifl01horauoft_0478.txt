26. fervidi, their hearts still warm with youth and passion, to
heighten the contrast of the cold, burnt>0ut torch, that can no longer
kindle love.

28. dilapsam. This seems to have been the reading of Acron.
though the MS. authority is rather in favour os ‘delapsam'; the con-
fusion is very common. As Bentley points out, the difference of the
image is between a torch bumt down to a heap of ugly ashes (‘con-
sumpta in cinerem,’ Aen), and of one ‘tumbled in the ashes* 3—what
ashes it is not quite clear.

ODE XIV.

*How can senate and people worthily honour thy virtues, Augustus,
and transmit their memory to all time? The triumphs of the Nero
brothers, of Drusus over the Vindelici, the Genauni and Breuni, os
Tiberius over the Raeti, arc all owing to thy auspices. How terrible
was Tiberius in the pursuit 3 as the south wind on the waters, or as the
river Aufidus when it pours in a torrent from the hills down on the
plain. Thine were the plan and provision of the campaign, thiae its
divinely-ordered success, for the victory came on a day already note-
worthy for thy happy fortune—just fifteen years after the capture of
Alexandria. Thy reign has been a series of triumphs, and now all the
world is at thy seet.'

For some account of Tiberius’ campaign in Rc. 15 see Introd. to
the Book.

Line 1. patrum . . Quiritium. Horace analyses and gives a poetical 1
form to the common formula sor the authority by which such titles or J
honours would be conserred, S. P. Q R.

2. plenis=‘iustis,’ ‘adequate.' No heaping upon him of offices ]

and honorary titles will be sufficient for his merits. The force of the
adjective must overflow on the other clauses, as the general thought is,
‘ how cau we adequately honour you now, or secure you the immortality
of honour which you dese1·ve?’ A genitive of the object with ‘munus ’
is not common; but cp. Ι. 28. 3 ‘ pulveris exigui munera.'

4. titulos, inscriptions on monuments and public buildings; 4. 8. 13.
