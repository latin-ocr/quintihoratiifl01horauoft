366 HORA TII CARMINA.

ODE XVIII.

A thn to Faunus; cp. 1. 17. 1—8. Horace prays that the visits of
the god to his lands may be kindly, and promises that the due kid and
wine and incense shall be offered at the Faunalia on the nones of
December, ,the holiday of cattle and of villagers, the day of peace, when
even the wolf strays hannlessly among the lambs 3 when the trees shed
their leaves to strew F aunus’ path, and the ditcher revenges himself on
the ground which has worked him so hard, by dancing on it.

Line 1. Nympharum amator. Faunus is identified with the Greek
Pan; see on 1. 17. Perhaps (as Ritter thinks) the words imply also
that it is in pursuit of his flying loves that Faunus is supposed to cross
the different homesteads.

4. alumnis, probably ‘younglings’ ofcattle; 3. 23. 7. The Scholiast
took it asz‘vernulis,' young slaves bred on the sarm, whom Faunus
was supposed to frightem Ritter‚ of the young trees and plants which
in his hot pursuit he might trample. Our interpretation is supported,
both in this place and in 3, 2 3. 7, by the words which follow. Faunus
must be kindly to the flock, because it pays tithe duly to him.

5. pleno anno, when the year is nearly full, in December; or,
perhaps, only like ⁴ per exactos annos,' 5. 22. 6=⁶ quotannis: at intervals
of a full year.

6. Veneris sodali craterae, ‘ the bowl‚ Venus’ mate.’ Orelli quotes
an address to a flagon, Βάκχου καὶ Μουσέων ἱλαρὴ λάτρι καὶ Κυθερείης.
Perhaps it is thus characterized as fitting the title given to Faunus in
v. 1. Ritter makes ‘craterae⁷ the genitive with ‘vina,’ ‘wine in the
b0wl‚’ some particular bowl known to be set for Faunus, and takes
‘Veneris sodali' of the god himself.

7. vetus implies that these rites have been duly performed during
many generations. Macleane puts a full stop at ‘craterae,’ and makes
the general description of the Faunalia begin here. >-

12. pagus. There is a curious variant in some of the best MSS„
‘pardus,' the origin of which Bentley ingeniously traces to some
monkish copyist, who had in mind the prophecy of Isaiah, 11. 6 ‘ Habi-
tabit lupus cum agno et pardus cum haedo accubabit?

14. spargit frondes. That the leaves were still falling in December,
see Epod. 11. 5 ‘December . . silvis honorem decutit?

agrestes, ‘ a woodland carpet ⁷ of leaves.

15. invisam, ‘invisam terram fossoribus merito dixit quod in ea ’ ’

laborant quum fodiunt,' Porph.
