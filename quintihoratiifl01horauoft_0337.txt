NOTES'. BOOK ll, ODE XVII. 301

†Gyas. The MSS. in 3. 4. 69 read ‘ gigas’; in this place they are
divided between ‘ gigas' and ‘gygas’ Cruquius’ MSS. all having the
latter. ‘Gigas' was read by Porph.‚ Aer. (who interprets it by ‘Briareus
de quo Virgilius Aen. 10. 564 ’), and Priscian (17. 152). In Ovid, how-
ever, the name of the hundred-handed giant occurs in three places where
the metre excludes the proper case of ‘gigas,’ Trist. 4. 7, Amor. 2. 1.
12, Fast. 4.. 593. 1n the first of these passages the MSS. vary between
⁴ Gygen‚' ‘ Gyam‚' and ‘ Gian.’ In Hesiod, Theog. 149, 714, 734, where
three brothers are named Κόττος τε Βριάρευς τε Γύγης θ’ ὑπερήφανα
τέκνα, the MSS. vary between Γύγης and Γύης. Apollodorus, the
mythologist, gives the name as Γύης. Against the sorm Γύγης must be
counted the fact that both in Greek (see Archilochus, Fr. 21 οὔ μοι τὰ
Γύγεω τοῦ πολυχρύσου μέλει) and in Latin (Hor. Od. 2. 5. 20, 3. 7. 5)
its penultima is lengthened. On this evidence Keller writes here, and
in Od. 3. 4. 69, ‘Gyas’ In itself a proper name is more likely than
the general ‘ gigas.'

15, 16. ‘Hoc et iustum est et decretum a Parcis‚’ Ritter. Δι’κη is
sister to the Μοῖραι in Hes. Theog. 902. For the position of ‘que' see
on Od. 1. 30. 6.

17. seu . . seu . . seu, see Introd. to the Ode. Compare with the
whole passage Persius’ imitation, Sat. 5. 45 soll. ‘Non equidem hoe
dubites, amborum foedere certo Consentire dies et ab uno sidere duci:
Nostra vel aequali suspendit tempora Libra Parca tenax veri. seu nata
fidelibus hora Dividit in Geminos concordia fata duorum, Saturnumque
gravem nostro Iove frangimus una: Nescio quid, certe est, quod me tibi
temperat astrum! Compare also for the influence attributed to some
of the planets and signs of the Zodiac here named, Propert. 5. 1. 83
foll. ‘ Felicesque Iovis stellas Martisque rapacis, Et grave Saturni sidus
in oti-ipe caput; Quid moveant Pisces, animosaque signa Leonis, Lotus
et Hesperia quid Capricornus aqua.‘ Each planet had a special rela—
tion to some sign of the Zodiac; Venus to Libra, Mars to Scorpio,
Saturn to Capricornus

adspicit, the present tense, as the influence of the star which was in
the critical position at the moment os the chilu’s birth continues through
his life.

18. pars violentior, ‘more stormy influence in the hour of birth’;
Manil. 4. 217 soll. ‘Scorpios armatae metuendus cuspide caudae . . In
bellum ardentes animos et Martia corda Efficit et multo gaudentem
sanguine Syllam.’

19. tyrannus Hesperiae undae, cp⁴ Propert. l. c. Horace probably
gives this title (cp. ‘arbiter Hadriae‚’ 1. 3. 15) to Capricorn as the
mid-winter sign. Cic. Nat. D. 2. 44 (froin Aratus) ‘Tum gelidum
valido de pectore frigus anhelans Corpore semifero magno Capricornus
