ODE XIX.

‘Come‚ Telephus, enough of your antiquarian lore; attend to the
more practical question where and when we are to sup this cold night?
Then, with a sudden change, he fancies the banquet already prepared
(cp. 2. 7. 21 foll„ 2. 11. 18 foll.): ‘We have to drink the new month,
and our friend Murena, the newly-elected Augur. Strike up with pipe
and harp; no grudging, scatter the roses. Let morose old Lycus hear
our riot next door, and his ill-matched young wife. We are better

matched here, Telephus and Rhode, I and Glycera?

Telephus is a mythological name which Horace used before in 1. 13
(see Introd. to that Odel, and uses again in 4. 11. 21. It is os course
possible that a real person is intended in this case, though it is hard to
see why his name should be concealed. Ritter hits upon the rhetorician
Heliodorus, the companion of Horace's journey to Brundisium (⁵ Grae-
corum longe doctissimus,' Sat. 1. 5. 3), with whose profession such
antiquarian questions would suit, and whose name he fancies to be
etymologically played on in ‘ Telephus’ (τῆλε φάος).
