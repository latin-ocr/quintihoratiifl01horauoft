6 JNTRODUCTION TO THE

In B.C. 30, M. Crassus, at the bidding of Octavianus, marched
northward from Macedonia, and won some victories over the
Daci and Bastarnae as well as the Moesi, for which he was
allowed a triumph, Dio 51. 23.

From the Epitome of Livy (B. 135) it appears that Crassus
was again fighting in Thrace in Rc. 25.

Florus (4. 12, ᾧ 18> speaks of Lentulus driving the Daci
beyond the Danube, but no date is given. His words may be
worth quoting for his mention of Cotiso (Od. 3. 8. 18) and for
the illustration of Horace's expression ‘intra praescriptum
equitare,' Od. 2. 9. 23: ‘Daci montibus inhaerent; Cotisonis¹
regis imperio quoties concretus gelu Danubius iunxerat
ripas decurrere solebant et vicina populari. Visum est Caesari
Augusto gentem aditu difficillimam submovere. Misso igitur
Lentulo ultra ulteriorem repulit ripam: citra praesidia con-
stituit, sic tunc Dacia non victa sed submota atque dilata est.

Sarmatae patentibus campis inequitant; et hos per eundem
Lentulum prohibere Danubio satis suits

It is obvious that there is nothing here to fix the date of the
debated Ode 3. 8. The victory of Crassus will satisfy the
expressions of y. 18, and so would the victory of Lentulus, but
this last is itself undated.

The only political event connected with the Eastern Scythians
which is alluded to in these Books, is their interference on behalf
of Phraates, which will be noticed immediately under the Par-
thian affairs.

ᾧ 8. Parma—The defeats of Roman armies under Crassus,
Decidius Saxa (the legatus of M. Antony), and M. Antony him-
self, in ΒΕ. 53, 40, and 36, though the objects of frequent refer-
ence in Horace⁷s poemS, and grounds ofthe keen interest taken ’

in Parthian affairs, and of the stress laid on the mission of ,¹

Augustus to restore Roman prestige in the East, yet all fall
without the period assigned for the composition of the Odes.

The only contemporaneous event of Parthian history is that s

¹ Suetonius, Oct. 63, calls him ‘Getarum 1’ex‚’ and gives a story, on
Antony's authority, of Augustus having at one time promised Julia in
marriage to him, and asked a daughter of his in return.
