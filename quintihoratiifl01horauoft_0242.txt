206 HORA TII CARMJNA.

stomacho, the seat of anger. see on Od. 1. 6. 6. ,
17. Thyesten. Thyestes stands as the representative of the crimes

of passionate reve-nge in Greek Tragedy. Cp. Od. 1. 6. 8 ‘Saevam

Pelopis domum?
18. ultimae, the surthest off, the first link of the chain. Ritter quotes

Virg. Aen. 7. 49 ‘tu sanguinis ultimus auctor.'

19. stetere. By the variation from the usual ‘ exstitere‚’ Horace
clearly wishes to feel again something of a living inetaphor in the verb,
though it is not quite evident what the metaphor is. Cp. Virg. Aen. 7.
553 ‘ stant belli causae.’ There it seems to be ‘ they are on foot, in full
lise and strength, there is no need to use any more efforts to arouse
them? Here perhaps the verb cannot be altogether separated from
· ultimae.’ ‘ They have been the primary and sufficient cause‚' that
which stands os its own strength, leans on no other.

20. imprimeret muris aratrum, to plough the site of a conquered
city was a token (or a metaphor) of its total destruction. Prop. 4. 9.
41 ‘ Moenia cum Graio Neptunia pressit aratro Victor Palladiae ligneus

artis equus.' Cp. Aesch. Ag. 526.
22. me quoque, as well as the rest of the world, as it may you. Take

care you are not as bad as Ι was in your revengesulness.
23· tentavit, of a disease; Epp. 1. 6. 28 ‘Si latus aut renes morbo

tentantur'; Virg. G. 5. 441 ‘ Turpis oves tentat scabies?
dulei iuventa, ‘ so sweet,' says Dim, ‘ that one can think of nothing

else, its pleasures make one careless’; cp. Od. 1. 37. 11 ‘dulci fortuna
ebria. Orelli thinks it is only the fondness with which a man, as he

grows old, looks back on his youth, and pleads sor it even while he

recounts its errors.
24. celeres, ‘ hasty,' ‘ impetuous'; cp.Epp.1.18.89‘oclerunt . ,sedatum

celeres’; but there is some force in giving the epithet to the ‘iambi'
rather than to himself. He would suggest that his Pegasus ran away

with him.
26. tristia, perhaps with reference to v. 9. Here, as contrasted with

‘ mitibus‚' it carries more distinctly a metaphor os taste, as Virg. G. 2.
126 ‘tristes succi ’3 G. 1. 75 ⁴ triste lupinum.'

ODE XVII.

An invitation to Tyndaris to visit the poet at his Sabine farm, ‘a very
haunt of Faunus, a heaven-blest spot, where she will find all country
pleasures, and be able to sing her favourite songs and sip Lesbian in the
shade without the brawls of a city merryrnaking or the tipsy violence

os Cyrus’ love and jealousy.’
