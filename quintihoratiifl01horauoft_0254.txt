borders the Syrtes as ‘aestuosae rura Calabriae‚' Od. ῐ. 31. 5, or of
the boiling surf of the bay; ‘ Barbaras Syrtes ubi Maura semper Aestuat
unda‚' Od. 2. 6. 3. Perhaps the similarity of that place makes for the
latter interpretation, as in that case both passages will combine the
same two dangers. Yon have to choose between a furious sea, if you
don‘t land, and savage inhabitants if you do. The proverbial danger
of the Syrtes consisted partly in the number of sunken rocks 111 the bay,
partly in deep quicksands which lined the shore. ¹

6. inhospitalem Caucasum, Epod. 1. 103 Aesch. P. V. 20, of the
same mountains, τῷδ’ ἀπανθρώπῳ πάγῳ.

7. fabulosus, with its storied dangers, the stories that would be
told of India as of any unknown southern country, of its jungles, its
strange beasts. The Hydaspes is a river of the Punjaub‚ the modern
Jelum, Virg. G. 4. 211.

8. lambit, used of the gentle wash of water, as of fire, S. 1. 5. 73,
Virg. Aen. 2. 683, etc.

9. namque. The whole force of the Ode is thrown on Horaee's
miraculous escape, which is the sufficientjustification both of the general
statement in the two preceding stanzas of the safety of innocence, and
of the particular statement in the two that follow of the poet's own
indifferenee to outward circumstances, see Introd. to 1. 34.

10. ultra terminum, beyond the bounds of his own farm. A few
acres ofthe sorest belonged to him, Od. 3. 16. 29, S. 2. 6. 3.

11. expeditis, as Catull. 31. 7 ‘O quid solutis est beatius curist’? a
variation of the more usual ⁶ expedire, solvere animum curis? Bentley
(and Keller follows him) adopts ‘expeditus’ from some MSS. of less
weight. Dill1'. supports the ablative on the ground that Horace inclines
to ὁμοιοτέλευτα 111 Sapphic verses. Macleane points out that there are
six other instances in this Ode, vv. 3, 9, 14, 17, 18, 22.

13. portentum, sc. the wolf, τέρας, πέλωρον; not that to see a wolf
there was such a wonder, but he means to express the shock which the
sight gave him, and half playfully turns the wolf into a monster.

militaris, *the land of 50101015,Ί is chiefly a complimentary epithet
to the poet’s birth—place, cp. 3. 5. 9 ³ sub rege Medo Marsus et Apulus ’ ;
2. Ι. 34 ‘ Dauniae caedes.' All other Roman excellences are in the
‘same way attributed to the Apulians, industry and hardness to the men,
housewifely virtues to the women, Od. 3. 16. 26, Epod. 2. 42. A com-
parison, however, of Ι. 17. 9 (see note there) suggests that there is some
connection of thought between the size of the wolves and the soldierly
character of the inhabitants.

14. Daunias, Apulia, so called, according to Festus, from Daunus,
an Illyrian prince who settled in it and became the son-in-law of
Diomede, see on Od. 3. 30. 11. ⁶ Daunias' is a Greek form, not found
