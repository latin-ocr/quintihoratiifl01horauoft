things besides the King os Scythia. Others make ‘ quis' a nom„ ‘who
is the king so terrible‚' etc. It will still, on our view, refer to the fears
of Tiridates. Dillr„ however, urging the parallel ‘infidos agitans dis-
cordia fratres, Nec coniurato descendens Dacus ab Istro‚' Virg. G. 2.
496, 497, takes ‘ metuatur ' of the fears of the Romans themselves, and
the Scythiam king (cp. Od. 1. 19. 10, and see on 3. 8. 18) as repre-
senting the barbarians north of the Danube, of whose incursions so
much is made in Horace.

5. unice, though every one else is full of these questions.

6. fontibus integris, etc. A second reminiscence (see Od. 1. 7. 7)
of Lucr. 1. 926 ‘iuvat integros accedere sontes Atque haurire; iuvatque
novos decerpere flores‚' etc. Observe how Horace combines the two
claims sor his poetry, ‘integris‚’ ⁵ novis fidibus,’ and yet ‘ Lesbio
plectro'3 cp. Epp. 1. 19. 21 ‘Libera per vacuum posui vestigia prin-
ceps, Non aliena meo pressi pede . . Parios ego primus iambos Ostendi
Latio' ; see on Od. 1. 1. 29. He only claims originality in imitation.

9. Pimplea, prop. the name of a fountain in Pieria (cp. ⁶ Pierides
Musae '), near Mount Olympus. Horace uses it as an adj. of the
Muse who haunts the spot. Bentley and others would read the Greek
form ‘ Pimplei ' against the MSS„ which vary only between ⁶ Pimplea '
and ‘ Piplea.’

mei honores, ‘honours that Ι can give’3 cp. Pind. Nem. 9. 21
ἐπασκήσω κλυταῖς ἥρωα τι μαῖς.

11. sacrare, to canonize, to give the immortality which so many
stout hearts have lacked sor want of a ‘ vates saeer,' Od. 4. 9. 2 5.

ODE XXVII.

1n Od. 1. 18 the poet had recommended moderation in the use of
wine on moral and religious grounds· Here his object is the same
though the tone is lighter. The Ode is a dramatic sketch of a banquet
which is degenerating into a drunken brawl. Horace interrupts it by
ν an appeal, playful in its mixture of the Bacchic hierophant with the
genial poet of good living. The company would reply to their monitor
by filling his glass. ‘ On one condition only‚’ he says, and diverts them
at once from his own lecture and their rising quarrel to an absorbing
interest in the love affairs of Megilla's brother, his bashfulness, his
imagined confidences, his mysteriously hopeless fate.

It is at least an ingenious suggestion of Ritter’s that the ⁶ Opuntiae
frater Megillae’ is the same as the Xanthias Phoceus of Od. 2. 4,
whom Horace banters on his love for a slave girl (the ‘Charybdis ⁷ on
this view of this Ode), neither ‘ fidelis,' is we read the irony aright, nor
⁶ luero aversa’; see the Introd. to that Ode.
