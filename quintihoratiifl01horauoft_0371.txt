marry, and grow old as their slaves? What a change from the old
spirit, the spirit os Regulus !’

Crassi. M. Licinius Crassus Dives, the rival of Caesar and Pompey,
and sharer with them in the league sometimes called the First Trium—
virate, was defeated 1³.c. 53, at Charrae in Mesopotamia, by Surenas,
general of Orodes 1; 20‚000 Romans were said to have been taken
prisoners, and 20,000 lest dead, amongst whom was Crassus.

coniuge barbara. Neither with ‘turpis,’ as Ritter takes it, nor
necessarily with ‘ maritus‚' as Dills. and Orelli, though they support it
by Ov. Her. 4. 1. 34 ‘fratre marita soror‘, but an ablative ‘ absolute ’
as much as ‘te duce,’ etc. (see on 2. 1. 12), an ablative of the circum-
stance which justifies the whole appellation ‘ turpis maritus‚' the collo-
cation pairing, in Horace's manner, the correspondent words ἶ turpis,’
‘barbara‚’ ‘maritusj ‘coniuge’ The ‘disgrace’ the Commentators
illustrate from Virg. Aen. 8. 688 ‘ sequiturque (nefas) Aegyptia coniux,’
and Liv. 43. 3 ‘ex militibus Romanis et ex Hispanis mulieribus cum
quibus connubium non esset natos se memorantes.’

6. vixit, as its place shows, emphatic, ⁶ has endured life,' has bought

‘ life at such a price.

7. pro clu-ia, ‘the senate,’ as in 2. Ι. 14 ‘consulenti curiae.' The
force of ‘ inversi’ is thrown back upon ‘ curia ' after Horace's manner:
see on 1. 2. 1, cp. 1. 5. 5, ‘fidem mutatosque Deos! ‘The senate is
changed, and the whole spirit of morals and discipline, of which it was
the guardian, is overset.’ Compare the part played by the senate in
the subsequent story of Regulus, v. 45.

8. socerorum, plural, as Hom. Il. 3. 49 νυὸν ἀνδρῶν αἰχμητάων, and
Theoer. 24. 82 ’γαμβρὸς ἀθανάτων.

armis. So the MSS. with only one exception, and the reading is
illustrated by Justin’s account of the practice of the Parthians, 41. 2. 5
‘ exercitum non ut aliae gentes liberorum, sed maiorem partem serviti-
orum habent,’ and by the story (quoted by Merivale from Flor. 4. 10,
and Vell. Patere. 2. 82) of the assistance rendered to the expedition of
M. Antonius by a Roman in the Parthian ranks, ‘ qui clade Crassiani
exercitus captus . . fortunam non animum mutasset? Canter's con-
jecture, ‘arvis,’ was warmly supported by Bentley. It has since been
found in one MS. of no great antiquity. There is force in Bentley's
argument, that Horace's indignation is moved not by Romans having
borne arms against their country, ‘quod falsum et inauditum: but by
their consenting to live and marry among their captors, ‘ obliti Romani
nominis.⁷ The charge seemS, vv. 25, 30, 31, 36, to be rather that they
are eowards than renegades. In the presence, however, of the MS.
testimony he has not persuaded many of the editors.

9. sub rege, ‘invidiosum apud Romanos nomen,' Orell.
