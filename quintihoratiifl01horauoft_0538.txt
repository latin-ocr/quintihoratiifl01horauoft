502 USE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE.

On the first point we may compare ‘ celer irasci⁷ or ‘praesens
tollere' with ‘ blandum quercus ducere.' In either of the first
two cases the adjective and the infinitive are essential to one
another—it is a mere accident of language that the ‘irascibility’

or the ‘power of listing’ is not expressed in a single word—but ³

in the third case the idea of each is complete: the infinitive
adds an illustration, almost a result, of the quality named by
the adjective, it is almost=‘ta1n blandus ut ducat.⁷

On the second point we may notice the change in the rela- Ἰ

tion of the infinitive (a) when the adjective to which it is
appended is negative in sense. This is clear in such cases as
‘indoctus ferre,⁷ ‘timidus perire,> ‘piger ferre': it may cause
some ambiguity when the negative character of the adjective is
less clear, or where it would have been equally open to the poet
to regard it from its positive side, and to make the infinitive
the complement of the whole, not merely of the positive part,
viz. the attribute denied or disparaged. Contrast, eg. ‘ferre
iugum pariter dolosi ² with ‘ cautum dignos assumere‚’ “callidum
condere‚' etc. 3 (b) in such cases as the last three given above,

ἢ where the adjective and the infinitive seem to have changed

places, where it 15 no longer an internal quality of the subject

leading to some action, but an action which is the cause or ζ
ground of the attribute, no longer ‘ brave so as to conquer,' but '

⁵ famous because he conquers.'

‘Niveus νωθής Od. 4. 2. 59 (like ‘nefas videre‚' Epod. 16. 14),
seems to be more purely an imitation of a Greek idiom (λευκὸς 3

ὁρᾶσθαι, ἀθέμιτον ἰδεῖν).
