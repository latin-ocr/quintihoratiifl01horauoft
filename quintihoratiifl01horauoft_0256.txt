ἀγανῶς οἷά τε νεβρὸν νεοθηλέα
’γαλαθηνὸν ὅστ’ ἐν ὔλῃς κεροέσσης
ἀπολειφθεὶς ὑπὸ μητρὸς ἐπτοήθη.

Line 1. vitas. This was the reading of the Comm. Cruq. and is found
in one MS. of the loth century (π); but if it be right, it was very early
corrupted to ‘ vitat,' which is read in B and all the other roth century
MSS„ was interpreted by Porph. and Aer„ and is quoted by Diomedes.
A change from the third person in v. 1 to the second in v. 9 would be
strange in the absence of any change of tone to account for it; and,
on the other hand. a misunderstanding of the subj. of ‘tremit’ may
have led a copyist to assimilate ‘vitas' to it. On the metrical question,
see on Οὐ.. 1. 15. 24. and Index of Metres.

4. aurarum et siluae, cp. Yirg. Aen. 2. 728 ‘Nunc omnes terrent
aurae sonus excitat omnis.’ ‘Sihtae’ is a trisyll. as in Epod. 13. 2; so
⁶ miluus‚’ Epod. 16. 32.

5. veris . . adventus, ete., ‘if through the light-hung leaves hath
run the shiver of spring's approachss i. e. of the ‘ animae veris comites,'
Od. 4. 12. 1; Lucret. 5. 735 ‘ It ver et Venus et Veneris praenuntius
ante Pinnatus graditur Zephyrus.' Bentley, pressing ‘ adventus' too
closely. ohjects that when spring is still approaching there are no leaves
nor lizards nor fawns, and is displeased at the boldness of attributing
the shiver to the approach of spring rather than to the leaves, see 4. 4,
7. Muretus had written (⁴ ex codd.³ but no extant MS. is known to
have it) ‘Vitis inhorruit Ad ventum,' which Bentley accepted, altering
‘vitis' to ‘vepris,' a conj. which had occurred independently to Sal-
masius. The Vulg. was read by the Scholiasts.

7. lacertae, Vrrg. E. 2. 9 ‘Nunc virides etiam occultant spineta
lacertos?

8. tremit, sc. hinnuleus.

9. atqui, ‘and yet‚' Od. 3. 5. 49, Epod. 5. 67.

aspera, ‘angry,' as ‘ asperas serpentes,’ Od. 1. 37. 26; ‘asperum
tactu leone1n,' 3. 2. 10; ‘ asper siti anguis,' Virg. G. 3. 434.

10. Gaetulus leo, Od. 3. 20. 2, Virg. Aen. 5. 351, see on v. 15 of
the last Ode. ’

frangere. of crushing between the teeth; Virg. G. 2. 72 ‘glan-
demque sues fregere sub ulmis’; Hom. 11. 11. 113 ὡς δὲ λέων ἐλάφοιο
ταχεῖης νήπια τέκνα Ῥηϊδίως συνέαξε λαβὼν κρατεροῖσιν ὀδοῦσιν. For the
infin. see App. 2, ᾗ 1.
