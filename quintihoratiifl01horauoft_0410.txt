374 HORATII CARMJNA.

and your flocks shall be kept safe. Costly sacrifices are sor the “ ponti·

fices.'' Put your garlands of rosemary and myrtle on the little images l

of your gods, and there is no need for more. without any gifts but the
salted cake you may win their favour, as much as by a sumptuous
victim.'

‘The gods accept the humble offerings of humble people. Modera-
tion, simplicity, thrift, content with our own station, have place in

religious observance as well as in other phases of life? This is all the ¹

doctrine of the Ode. The name Phidyle (Gr. fem. of Φειδύλος) is clearly
chosen to characterise a ⁵ thrifty ’ Sabine housewife. ¹

‘tendoque supinas Ad caelum cum voce manus.’ The hands were held ’

open with the palms upward. ‘Supinas ferre manus ’ might be=xefpa5 ζ

ἀνασχεῖν, and be a common way of saying ‘ to pray ’ς possibly, in com· j

bination with the other particulars, ‘nascente Luna: ‘thure,’ ‘horna
fruge) ete. it helps the idea of punctual ritual performance.

2. nascente Luna, on the first of the month; see on 3. 19. 9, Cato

de R. R. 143 ‘Kalendis . . coronam in focum indat3 per eosdemque dies
Lari familiari pro copia supplicet.’ Cp. Tibull. 1. 3. 34 ‘Reddereque
antiquo menstrua thura Lari‚’ and read the same poet, 1. 10. 15—28‚
where many expressions of this Ode find a parallel.

3. horna fruge, the firstfruits of the year’s corn3 ‘spicea serta,’
Tibull. l. c.

4. porea, ‘ Hostia erit plena rustica porcus hara ’ ib„ ‘immolet aequis
Hic porcum Laribus,⁷ Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 165. Why ‘avida“? Ovid, speak-
ing of sacrificing a pig to Ceres (Fast. Ι. 349), makes its greediness the
ground of its fate: ‘Nam sata vere novo teneris lactentia succis Eruta

8. grave tempus, ‘the sickly time when the year bears its fruits.’
For the ablative see 2. 7. 16 ‘fretis aestuosis.’ With ‘pomifero anno '
cp. ‘ annus hibernus‚' Epod. 2. 29; for the sickliness of autumn cp. Od.
2. 14. 15, Sat, 2. 6. 19.

9. pascitur, ‘is even now feeding.'

Algido; see on 1. 21. 6, where ‘gelido’ is possibly the same as
‘nivali ‘ here. Cp. 4. 4. 57.

10. devota, already destined for sacrifice. Cp. Virg. G. 3. 157, where
the destination of the different ealves is settled immediately on their
birth : ‘Aut aris servare sacros aut scindere terram!
