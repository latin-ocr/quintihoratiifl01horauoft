350 ΗΘΚΛ TII CARMJNA.

retro, constr. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘ currente ¹ and with ‘ eat.'

12. ‘Your father was a Tuscan; you are no Penelope to resist
suitors.' For the form cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 42 ‘ non me Tibi Troia Exter-
num tulit?

Tyrrhenus, perhaps only ‘ we know all about y0u3 you must not set
up for more than you are.' But the Etruscans seem to have had a
bad name for luxurious living.

14. tinctus viola panor, generally interpreted like Virg. E. 2. 48
‘pallentes violas,' of the yellow violet. It appears to have been taken
so by Calpurnius (Ecl. 9. 40) of an unhappy lover, ‘Pallidior buxo
violaeque simillimus erro.⁵ But the words themselves more naturally
suggest Ritter’s interpretation, ‘sublividus‚’ of a pale face scored with
dark lines under the eyes.

15. Pieria, from the borders of Macedonia and Thessaly, as ‘Thressa
Chloe?

17. rigida aesculo, seems to be a continuance of the image of
‘ curvat‚' ‘ You are as hard to bend as an oak bough.’

19. aquae caelestis; Epp. 2. 1. 135.

20. latum he represents himself as lying on the doorstep, ‘porrectum
ante fores.’ Cp. Epod. 11. 32 ‘Limina dura quibus lumbos et infregi
latus?

ODE XI.

O Mercury and my lyre, teach me some strain that will win the
obdurate ear of Lyde. She is like a young unbroken colt; but music
has made tigers and forest trees and rivers stay to listen. 1¹: has tamed
Cerberus, and beguiled the pain of Ixion and Tityus and the Danaids
with their leaking pitehers. Let Lyde hear their tale-how they slew
their husbands‚ all save one—their punishment, and Hypermnestra's
undying glory.

Lyde is warned not ‘placito pugnare amori’ by the story of the
Danaids and their punishment, and the noble exception of Hyper—
rnnestra. The application of the story is not very close. The form of
the Ode seems to be a nearer imitation than usual of the construction
of an Ode of Pindar; the commencement by an invocation of Mercnry
and the lyre; the accidental way in which, through the recountal of
the seats of music. the Danaids are introduced; the myth told at length,
but lest to be applied by the reader’s wit. Compare 3. 3 and 3. 27.

For the story of the Danaids read Aesch. Pr. V. 853—869 and Ov.
Her. 14 ‘Hypermnestra Lynceo? which contains frequent reminiscences
and expressions of passages in this Ode. Compare vv. 3. 4 ⁶ Clausa
domo teneor graw‘busque coercita vinclis: Est mihi supplicii eausa
