xxiv JNTRODUCTIOM

‘plerique,' ‘commentator’ (Aer. on A. P. 120), ‘qui de personis
Horatianis scripserunt' (Porph. on Sat. 1. 3. 21 and 91, 2.
5. 92).

O. Keller,1 who has collected and used with much ingenuity
all the available evidence on the subject, gives the palm of
antiquity to the Scholia of Porphyrion. The only limit set to
their date by external testimony is to be found in the mention
of Porphyrion’s name by Charisius, a grammatical writer,
usually placed about A.D. 4003 but Keller thinks they are as
early as 200—250 ΑΒ. The evidence on which he relies consists
wholly of indications in the Scholia themselves, such as (a) the
writer’s personalknowledge of Rome coupled with the fact that he
never alludes to the walls of Aurelian (A.D. 271), while he recog·
nizes the older gates, as eg. the Porta Esquilina on Epod. 5.
100, Sat. 1. 8. 1 3 (b) his use of Parthi, Parthicus, etc. as desig-
nations of the great eastern monarchy, in several places where
the Pseudo-Acron uses Persae, Persicus, a natural variation if
the fall of Parthia and the rise of the Persian dynasty of the
Sassanidae (ΑΒ. 226) had taken place between the two dates ;
(c) his way of speaking of the religious ceremonies of heathen
Rome as though they were still observed in his own time.
Contrast, eg. his note on Od. 3. ΙΙ. 6 ‘fidicines hodieque
Romae sacrificiis adhiberi videmus' with Acron’s ‘et in sacri-
ficiis fidicines adhiberi consueverant,' or that on Od. 2. 16. 14
‘salinum, patella in qua primitiae dis cum sale dantur' with
Acron's ‘patella in qua dis primitiae offerebantur,' or lastly,
that on 3. 5. 11 ‘Aeternam Vestam, propter aeternos ignes qui
in ara eius coluntur' with Acron’s ‘aeterni ignis qui in ara eius
indefesse colebatur.' Ἰ

The genuine Acron wrote earlier than Porphyrion, if the J
latter’s quotation of him on Sat. 1. 8. 25 is not an interpolation,
‘memini me legere apud Helenium Acronem Saganam fuisse

libertum Pomponii senatoris qui a triumviris est proscriptus.' ³

It is to be remarked, however, that the statement thus quoted Ϊ

does not occur in the Scholia which go under Acron’s name. ἢ
