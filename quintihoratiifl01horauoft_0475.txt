for a month from Feb. 20, and as bearing the name os ‘ Ornithiae,' ‘tum
et hirundo venit? Cp. v. 5.

temperant, ‘ calm' the sea, after its winter disturbancc.

6. infelix avis. It is disticult to say whether the swallow (Epp. 1.
7. 13 ‘Cum Zephyris . . et hirundine prima’) or the nightingale (ἦρος
ἅγγελος ἴμερύφωνος ἀηδὼν, Sapph. Fr. 42) is ineant. The legend is told
in various ways, some poets making Procne the mother of Itys, and
some Philomela; see Conington, Virg. E. 6. 78. As Ovid tells it at
length (Met. 6. 4²4 solt), Procne was the daughter of Pandion, king of
Athens (‘Cecropiae domus! v. 6), and married to Tereus, a Thracian
prince. To avenge her sister Philomela, whom he had outraged, she.
served up to her husband the fiesh of their child Itys, and when he
would have taken vengeance on her, the sisters were changed, one into
a swallow‚ the other into a nightingale, Tereus himself into a hoopoe.

7. male, with ‘ ulta,' ‘ cruelly,' ‘unnaturally.‘

barbaras regum. The plural generahzes, an act of lust such as
barbarian princes used to cominit; the poetical transference of the
epithet from ‘regum' to ‘libidines,⁷ ·-does not separate it from the
princes, but connects it more closely with their acts. They were true
barbarians: their acts were those of barbarians.

11. deum, Pan.

nigri, covered with black woods; ‘nigris Erymanthi silvis,' 1. 21. 7.
Erymanthus is one of the ‘hills of Arcadia'; others are Lycaeus, 1.
17. 2, Maenalus, Virg. E. S. 22.

14. pressum Calibus; 1. 20. 9, 1. 31. 9.

ducere3 1. 17. 22.

15. iuvenum nobilium cliens; see Introd.

17. nardi parvus onyx. ‘ Onyx' is properly a kind of marble or
alabaster, so named from its resemblance in colour to the human nail;
then a cup or box, first, of this material; lastly, it would seem, of any
material. See Prop. 4. 10. 22 ‘ murreus onyx’3 ‘unguenta optime ser-
vantur in alabastris‚' Plin. N. H. 13. 5; ep. the ἀλάβαστρον μύρου
νάρδου πιστικῆς of St. Mark 14. 3. Dius„ who explains ‘ studium lucri '
in V. 25, of the bargain between the wine and the nard, quotes the
story in the Gospels, as showing the costliness of the nard (‘300 de-
narii’ :between «59 and ³610), sor which he also refers to Pliny 12. 26,
13. 2, 16. 59.

18. Sulpiciis horreis. ‘ Horrea’ were ‘ store-houses‘ os any kind;
see on 3. 28. 7. Here the reference is either to vaults where wine was
to be bought, or, less likely, to the store-houses in which, in later tImes,
we hear of persons keeping their property of various kinds for which

original erector of the'buildings, or possibly, as Orelli thinks, to the
