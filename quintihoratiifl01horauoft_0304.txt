money can spring from no vulgar stock. Nay, don’t suspect my praiseS,

We can hardly be wrong in supposing that, with the exception of
her pretty face and figure, the praises of Phyllis are meant to be in-
terpreted ironically. The mock heroic tone of the list of precedents
(cp. Od. 1. 16, Introd., and Epod. 3), the ‘regium certe‚’ and the
contempt implied for her real birth, ‘scelesta plebe‚' might be merely
playful3 but considering the topics of praise‚ ‘sie fidelem, sic lucro
aversa1r1‚' there is hardly feeling enough in their expression, standing as
they do between the Ievity of stanzas 4 and 6, to redeem the playfulness
srom the sting of irony.

And possibly the Ode refers to some real person, although the name
be fictitious. The irony would be wasted on a shadow; and there is a
definiteness both in the name of the ‘Phocian’ Xanthias and in the
introduction of Horace's own personality <stanza 6), which is more
dramatic than is usual in the purely imaginary Odes. It is undoubtedly ’
Horace's way to add a local designation to fictitious characters: ‘Cnidius
Gyges‚' Od. 2. 5. 20; ‘Liparaei nitor Hebri,' 3. 12. 6. In some cases,
as in ‘ Thurini Calais filius Ornyti,' 3. 9. 14, the appearance of com-
plete identitication is strongly in point, and in all the object probably
was to give a greater semblance of reality. The purpose here is the
less easy to imagine, from the fact that the name is addressed to
Xanthias himself, not used by way of identifying him to others. If the
lover of the Ode was a real person, there may of course be Some play
in the name, of which the point is lost to US. Orelli suggests that
‘ Xanthias ’ may be chosen to cover a Roman ⁶ Flavius,’ cp. Od. 3. 15.
11, where he thinks ‘Nothus' may represent a real ‘Spurius’ Ritter
imagines a Greek resident in Rome, and, comparing Od. 1. 27. 10

‘Megillae frater Opuntiae. ingeniously suggests that the person there
rallied' 15 none other than Xanthias‚ and that the Phyllis' of this Ode
is the‘ Charybdis' of that3 see Introd to 1. 27.

The composition of the Ode is fixed by v. 24 to the end of Horace' 5

stoop to a slave girl. Notice the antithetical placing of the words
throughout, ‘insolentem servas ‘ captivae dominum,’ ⁵ fessis leviora,'
