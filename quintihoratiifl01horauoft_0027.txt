THE SCHOLIASTS. xxiii

unknown poets‚ in the literary age of Rome, reproduced it with
a skill and completeness of which the known poets who have
tried to imitate it proved themselves incapable. The editors
who have done the most for the interpretation of Horace in this
generation (Orelli, Dillenburger, Ritter) are the least disposed
to allow of any spurious poems or passages in his text. But
though Peerlkamp's method of criticism must be pronounced
baseless, we may trace from it, as from its predecessor, indirect
results of value in the attention which it calls to the sequence
of thought, the lights and shades of style, and the varying merit
of the poetry.

II. Tlte Scholiasts.

The collections of Scholia on Horace which pass under the
names of Helenius Acron, and Pomponius Porphyrion, can
neither of them be certainly dated, and some doubt therefore
hangs over their relation to one another ; neither of them is in
a perfect state nor free from suspicion of interpolations. Not—
withstanding these drawbackS, they must be considered of very
high value. On questions of text the authority of the commen—
tary is at the least several centuries older than any MS of the
poet, either extant or known to us by testimony. Of course the
‘lelnmata,' or quoted words, to which the comment is affixed,
are of inferior importance, and they differ not unfrequently from
the text interpreted in the commentary, and can only by them—
selves carry us back to the date of the oldest MS. of the
Scholia, viZ. at the earliest to centuries 9—10. On questions
of interpretation, and especially of allusions to customs, sites,
and persons, the Scholia have value, independently of any
, doubt as to their writer's precise date or personal acquaintance
with Roman life, from the fact that they bear evidence ofhaving

, been composed by men who had in their hands early authori-

ties which are otherwise lost to us. These are sometimes re—
ferred to by name, as Terentius Scaurus (a grammarian of
Hadrian’s time who wrote a commentary on the Ars Poetica)
on Sat. 2. 5. 923 Claranus (Martial. 10. 21. 2, Seneca, Ep. 66)
on Sat. 2. 3. 833 more often generally as ‘nonnulli,’ ‘alii,'
