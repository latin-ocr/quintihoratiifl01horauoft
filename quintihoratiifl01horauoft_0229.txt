NOTES. BOOK l, ODE Xll. 193

us' would naturally suggest ‘ pareutum ' to a copyist who did not read
on, or view the Ode as a whole. with the ‘Quid prius dicam?⁷ cp.
Virg. E. 3. 60 ‘ Ab Iove principium, Musae) Theoe. 17. 1 ; and for the
whole order os the objects of the poet's pauses, ep. 4. 15. ,ιδ-32 ‘de-05

¹4· qm' res, etc„ Yirg. Aen. 1. 230 ¹ Ο qui res hominumque deum-
que Aeternis regis imperiis.’

15- mundum, surrounding space.

16. horis, like the Gr. ὥραις, ‘seasons‘; so again A. P. 302 ‘sub
verni temporis horam)

17. unde, ‘from wh0m,’ ofa person, Od. ῐ, 28. 28, Sat. 1. 6. η, 2. 6.
21. The Schol. quote Virg. Aen. 1. 6 ¹ genus unde Latiuum.’ Cp. the
use of ⁴ undique‚' Od. Ι. 7. 7.

secundum, Cic. Brut. 47 ‘nec enim in quadrigis eum secundum
numeraverim aut tertium qui vix e carceribus exierit cum palmam iam
primus acceperit.’

21. proeliis audax. Bentley, followed by miter, puts the stop aster
instead of before these words, making them an epithet of Pallas, who is
pre-eminently ‘ Armipotens‚' ‘Bellipote11s‚' etc. But Bacchus is ‘idem
pacis mediusque belli ’⁷ in Od. 2. 19. zS.

22. Virgo, Diaffiz-,jhjssuntress

pugnis, πυγμαχίᾳ, ‘ boxiug.'

27. alba steUa, see on Od. 1. 3. 2 ; ‘alba,’ probably as bringing back
clear weather, as ‘ albus Notus‚' Od. 1. 7. 15.

29. agitatus hmnor, ‘the wind-(higen spray) It has been blown
high up the rocks, now it streams down them aud is not blown up
again.

ponto is a local ablative, where in strictuess we require ‘in pontun]‚'
