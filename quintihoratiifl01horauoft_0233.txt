NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XIV. 197

ODE XIV.

The ship addressed has just escaped from a storm, its rnast broken, its
hull shattercd, its sails in ribands. The harbour is in sight. The wind
is rising again. It is warned not to drift back into a sea in which it

cannot live.

Quintilian (S. 6. 44) makes the Ode his illustration of the meaning of
the term ‘allegoria' ‘ Ut ‘⁶ O navis referent,'’ etc., totusque ille Horatii
locus quo navem pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis cix-ilibus,
portum pro pace atque concordia dicits And the poem of Alcaeus,
which looks like its model, was believed by the ancients to be an alle-
gorica] description of the political troubles of Mitylene :—

ἀσυνέτημι τῶν ἀνέμων στάσιν·
τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται,
τὸ δ’ ἔνθεν· ἄμμες δ’ ἂν τὸ μέσσον
miz· φορούμεθα σὺν μελαίνᾳ,
χειμῶνι μόχθεντες μεγάλῳ μάλα·
περ μὲν ’γὰρ ἄντλος ἶστοπέδαν ἔχει,
λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν ζάδηλον ἤδη
καὶ λάκιδες μέγαλαι κατ’ affro.

χόλαισι δ’ ἄγκυραι . . . (Fr. 18 Bergk.)

As long as we are content with Quintilian's general exposition, all is
simple. The allegory is satisfied when the commonwealth, in danger of
relapsing into civil war, has become a sea-wearied ship, (lrifting back
into the storm. The masts, the sails, the pine of Pontus, the Cyclades,
belong to the ship, and we must not look for their exact counterparts in
the State. Here, as with other allegorieS, we are beset with difficulties
the moment we attempt to fit the details more exactly. It has been
argued, from vv. 17. 18, that Horace speaks of the ship as if he had
himself left it (but see notes on those verses), and that the subject of the
Ode must, therefore, be not the State, but the Republican party. Why,
others ask, is it a Pontic pine, not some other—Idean, perhaps, as more
suitable to the mythical origin of Rome ’ἒ Acron suggested the answer,
which has since been developed into a whole theory of the purpose of
the Ode. Pompey was the conqueror of Mithridates of Pontus. The
ship, therefore, represents the fortunes of his son, Sextus Pompeius,
whom Horace would dissuade froin embarking again in war with Octa»
vianus after the treaty of Misenum, B.c. 30. ,
The difficulties of interpretation seemed so great to Muretus. Daeier,
and Bentley, that they refused to allow the Ode to be allegorical at all.
