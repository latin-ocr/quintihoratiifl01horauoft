what there is no reason otherwise to suppose, that Proculeius was dead
at this time.

metuente solvi, ‘that dare not droop‚' ‘is shy of drooping.' Od.
3, 11. 10, 4. 5. 20. Virgil had the expression first, G. 1. 246 *Arctos
metuentes aequore tingi.y

solvi, like Virgil's ‘ solw' membra,' λῦεσθαι; or possibly, as Ritter
suggests‚with a remembrance of Icarus’ fate, whose wings were fastened
with wax and melted in the sun. Cp. in a similar metaphorieal de-
scription of posthumous same, ‘ Daedaleo notior Icar0‚’ Od. 2. 20. 13.

9. latius regnes. In the following stanzas Horace is thinking of
the Stoic paradox, that the wise man is king. Cp. Sat. 1. 3. 125,
136, Epp. 1. 1. 107, etc„ Sen. Thyest. 334 foll. ‘Regem non faciunt
opes‚' etc.

10—1 2. ‘ Than if your property stretched into the sar South and VVest,
so as to unite in one sway Carthage and its Spanish colonies.’ Gades
was one of these: see Cic. pro Balbo 14, Liv. 28. 87. The expression
should be compared with Od. 5. 16. 31, 41 ‘ Fulgentem imperio fertilis
Asricae‚' ‘Mygdoniis regnum Alyattei Campis continuem.’ Horace is
not speaking in either case of proconsulships, but of the ‘latifundia'
(see on Od. 1. Ι. 9), which were one of the favourite means of investing
and acquiring wealth. Seneca expands this as other Horatian meta-
phors, Epp. 89 ‘ Hoc quoque parvum est nisi latifundiis vestris maria
cinxistis: nisi trans Hadriam et Ionium Aegaeumque vester villicus
regnet . . sit fundus quod aliquando imperium vocabatur? In both
passages of Horace the metaphor of royalty is suggested by the con—
text*here by ‘latius regnes ‘ and the allusion to Phraates, in 3. 16 by
‘ dominus splendidior ' and ‘ vectigalia.‘

11. et, ‘and so.’ Dius. draws attention to the consecutive force of
‘ et,’ as almost equal to ‘ita ut.’ Cp. 1. 3. 8, 4. 13. ιο.

13. indulgens sibi, ‘by indulging itself,' i.e. its own severish thirst.

hydrops, ‘the dropsy.' It is properly the subject of ‘crescit,’ but it
is made also the subject of ‘indulgens’ and ‘ pellit‚’ the actions of the
sick man being attributed to his malady.

14. neo sitim . . languor, ‘drinking increases the disease3 it cannot
quench the thirst till the malady which causes the thirst is gone, and
with it the other symptorns.¹ The application of the analogy is evident.
Cp. 3. 16. 17 ‘Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam Maiorumque fames!
Ovid reproduces the comparison5 Fast. 1. 212 ‘ quum possideant plurima
plura petunt: Sic quibus intumuit suffusa venter ab unda Quo plus sunt

potae plus sitiuntur aquae?
nisi. .venis They speak of drinking as though it immediately

filled the teins Sat 2. 4. 25 ‘vacuis committere venis Nil nisi lene
decet⁷3 of thirst as though it were felt in the mins, Ἣῖς. G. 3. 482
