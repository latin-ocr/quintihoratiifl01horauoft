world looked for a return of Deucalion’s deluge; cp. Virg. G. 1. 468
‘ Impiaque aeternam timuerunt saecula noctem?

6. monstra, anything strange and portentous; used in Virg. Aen.
3. 582 of the noises of Aetna; Aen. 7. 21, of the transformations
wrought by Circe.

questae, as a Greek might have used ἀγανακτεῖν. The word serves
to identify Pyrrha's feelings as well as her circumstances with those ‘of
the poet. She too said ‘ iam satis,’ ete.

7. pecus, ‘immania armenta . . phocas: Virg. G. 4. 395.

egit visere, App. 2. ξ 1.

9-1 2. Dillenburger points out how the words are chosen to emphasize
the general inversion of the natural order of things. The fish ‘cling'
as if they were birds—the deer ‘ swim ' as if they were fish.

13. vidimus, not necessarily of personal sight, ‘our generation has
seen3' Virg. G. 1. 471 ‘quoties Cyclopum effervere in agros Vidimus
undantem ruptis fornacibus Aetnam.’

flavum, Od. 1. 8. 8, 2. 3. 18-an habitual epithet‚ otherwise we
might take it as meaning ⁵ yellower than usual from the flood.'

retortis litore Etrusco, ‘ hurled back from the shore of the Tuscan
sea‚‘ i. e. driven back by the wind and so caused to flood. Horace uses
‘ litus Etruscum’ in two other places in this sense, C. S. 38, and Epod.
16. 40. And this was the common explanation of the flooding of
rivers. Cp. the account of the rise of the Nile, mentioned, though not
approved, by Herodotus, 2. 20. So Seneca, Nat. Q. 3. 26 ⁶ si crebri-
oribus ventis ostium caeditur et reverberatus fluctu amnis restitit: qui
crescere videtur quia non effunditur.' ‘ Litore Etrusco ' has been other-
wise taken of the right bank of the Tiber, against which the full stream
dashes, and is driven back so as to flood the lower left bank, ‘sinistra
ripa‚' v, 18. ‘Litus’ is used for a river bank in Virg. Aen. 3. 390,
8. 83.

15. monumenta regis would properly include both the ‘Atrium
Vestae,⁷ also called ‘Regia,' the residence of the Pontifex Maximus,
and the temple of Vesta, which was attached to it: both were attributed
to King Numa. The ‘que,⁷ however, does not couple so much the
names of two separate buildings as the two interests, historic and
religious, that attach to the same block of building. Note that the
identification of the cause of the flood with the murder of Caesar begins
in these words, see on v. 27.

16. templa. virgil uses the plural in the same way, Aen. 3. 84.
The temple of Vesta stood at the foot of the Palatine near the south-
west corner of the Forum.

17. nimium, with ‘ querenti,' ‘ complaining more than he could
bear :⁷ she complains of the murder of her great descendant. Horace
