NOTES. BOOKII, ODE IV. 269

7. arsit. There seems to be a play in the word, ‘He was fired by
her as he had fired Troy'; cp. Epod. 14. 13 ‘si non pulchrior ignis
Accendit obsessam Ilion.'

8. rapta, ‘captive' Hom. 11. 22. 62 υἷάς τ’ ὀλλυμένους ἑλκυσθεὶσας
τε θύγατρας. Compare the scene in Virg. Aen. 2. 403 foll. ‘Ecce
trahebatur passis Priameia Virgo Crinibus a templo Cassandra‚' etc.
There is an antithesis between ⁶ medio in triumpho' and ‘virgine rapta ’;
⁴ capta victorem cepit.' It is this feeling which gives its point to the
next stanza. ‘ When the warriors had fallen and the citadel of Troy
was an easy prey to its foes, then a captive maid vanquished the great

con ueror.'
13. Thessalo, as in Od. 1. 10. 15 ‘ Thessalos ignes,' i. e. the watch-

fires of Achilles.

victore is the abl. absol.; see on 1. 6. 1 and 2. 1. 12.

ademptus Hector, cp. 1. 37. 13 ‘minuit furorem Vix una sospes
navis,' but the constr. which attributes the action more personally to
Hector is intentionally chosen, as though by his death he was the very
traitor who opened the walls of Troy to the soe. Cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 17
⁴ Postquam primus amor deceptam morte fefellit?

11. leviora, perhaps with a remembranee of Hom. Il. 22. 287 καί κεν
ἐλαφρότερος πόλεμος Τρώεσσι -γένοιτο Σεῖο καταφθιμένοιοι but ‘leviora’
and ‘tolli ‘ probably match and make one metaphor.

fessis, ‘ even in their weariness,‘ Virg. Aen. 2. 108 foll. The dative
goes grammatically either with ‘tradidit' or with ‘leviora tolli,’ in
feeling with the latter; for the constr. ‘leviora tolli: see App. 2, ξ 2.

13. nescias, an, an extension of the common ‘ nescio ‹an‚' which
means, ‘I am not sure, but nearly so.’ It may be either potential,
‘Possibly you may be able to say, nescio an‚’ i. e. ‘ Possibly though
you know it not, auburn Phyllis has parents among the great, a wreath
of glory to you their son· in· -law‚’ or permissixe, ‘Xou may say, nescio
an,' i. e. ‘Y ou may be pretty sure ⁷.etc

15. regium genuS, after‘ maeret.' ‘Her tears a1e surely for some
royal ancestry and the unkindness of her home god5‚' who suffered her
to fall in the world.

17. de plebe, a tertiary predicate with ‘dilectam' ⁶ Believe that in
her thou hast not loved one from the rabble crowd.' Bentley inter-
prets ‘dilectam' as= ‘selectam.’ It is true that here, as often, though
not always, ‘diligere’ retains its force of ζ to love pre-eminently‚' ‘to
choose for love ’ς ‘dilectam Cypron‚' ‘ Cyprus of thy choice ’ς compare
Od. 2. 5. 17.

21. tereteS, ‘ well-turned,' ‘shapely.‘

23⁴. trepidavit, the stream has run quickly3 cp. ‘curret aetas,' Od.

2. 5. 13..
