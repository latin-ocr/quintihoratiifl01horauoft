460 HORATII EPODON LIBER.

14. felicioresx‚ as Virgil, of the grafted trec, G. 2. 81 ‘Exiit ad
caelum ramis felicibus.’ A

16. infirmas. The Scholiast interprets ‘ unable to bear the weight ἱ
of their wool’3 but it is probably no more than an habitual epithet·= 1
‘molle pecus,’ and only in point as helping the general idea of peace· ¹
fulness, ‘the unresisting sheep.'

17. vel, see on v. 9-12. Macl. rightly points out that the uses of
‘vel cums in an elliptieal construction with no apodosis (as in Virg.
Aen. 11. 406), although quoted by Orelli and others, are not relevant.
Sat. ε. 7. 95 is a real parallel. The apodosis here is ‘ ut gaudet‚' ‘how
he rejoicesl’ cp. v. 61 ‘ut iuvat?

19. gaudet decerpens, a Greek use of the participle, ἥδεται δρέπων.

20. certantem purpurae, ‘ rivalling the purple dye’: for dative
ep. 1. 1. 15 ‘luctantem fluctibus,’ etc.

21. Priapus is to be paid as the protector of gardens. Virg. E. 7.
33, Catull. 20. Silvanus is not only, as in Od. 3. 29. 23, the wild
forest-god, but also a patron of country life and pursuits, ‘arvorum
pecorisque deus,' Virg. Aen. 8. 601, and specially under the title of
‘Silvanus orientalis,' like Terminus, a protector of the sacred ‘land-
inark‚' the symbol of property, Dict. Biog. s. v.

23. Some good MSS. (not B, nor, as sar as appears, V) begin a new
Epode here, and Acron supports them, writing at v. 1 ‘Laus vitae
rusticae,’ and here ‘Introducit quendam feneratorem loquentem et
laudantem vitam quietam nee tamen suum propositum deserentem!
Porph. gives no indication. See Introd. to Od. 1. 7.

24. tenaci seems to mean ‘sost and deep,’ that makes a couch from
which you do not slip.

2 5. rivis, the reading of V and 133 though corrected in the latter by
a second hand to ‘ ripis,' the reading of the majority of MSS. Compare
against Orelli's objections to ⁶1·ivis,' Od. 2. 3. 11. ‘Altis rivis’ must
apparently mean ‘in brimming watereourses': ‘altis ripis' has been
variously rendered3 Bentley, who prefers it on the ground that we are
speaking of summer or autumn when streams are low, interprets ‘ with
their banks high: i.e. ‘ deep between their banks.’ Orelli thinks it is
not meant as a peculiarity of the time of year, but as a general charac-
teristic of the streams which adds to their beauty and pleasantness,
⁶ between high banks,’ i. e. of foliage, rocks, etc. But a comparison of
Luer. 2. 362 (in the same connection as this) ‘summis labentia ripis‚’
and Quint. 1 2. 2 ‘ Ut vis amnium maior est altis ripis multoque gurgitis
tractu fluentium quam tenuis aquae et obiectu lapillorum resultantis’
would suggest that if Horace wrote ‘ altis ripis' he meant rather ‘high
up its banks,’ so that it comes to the sanie as ⁵ rivis.'

27. obstrepunt, sc. ‘audientibus‚' see Od. 3. 30. 10. Markland
