NOTES. BOOK II, ODE Xll. 285

bal. and the sea-fights os the First Punic XVar, stand for Roman wars
generally.

2. durum, so the great majority of MSS. Bentley compares Virg. G.
3. 4 ⁴ Eurysthea du1·urn‚’ and points out that there is a Horatian antithesis
between it and the ‘ molles citharae modi.’ Orelli follows earlier
editors in altering it on very slight MS. authority to ‘ dimmf the epithet
of Hannibal in Od. 3. 6. 32, 4. 4. 42, quoting Quintil. 8. 2. 9 ‘proprie
dietum id est quo nihil inveniri possit significantius ut Horatius “ acrem
tibiam‚” ‘⁶ Hannibalemque dirum '’.'

Siculum mare. This name, which is generally given to the sea to
the east of Sicily, is used by Horace of the sea between its north coast
and Italy3 see 3. 4. 28 ‘ Sicula Palinurus unda? The chief vietories re-
ferred to will be those of C. Duilius in Be. 260 off Mylae, on the north
coast near Messina, and of L. Lutatius Catulus in 242 off the Aegates
Insulae, at the western extremity of the island.

5. nimium mero, ‘ overcharged with wine.' Cp. ‘fiducia nimius?
Sall. Fr.; ‘ rebus secundis nimii‚’ Tact. Hist. 4. 23. Cp. Od. 1. 18. S ‘Cen-
taurea . . cum Lapithis rixa super mero Debellata.’ Virgil names Hylaeus
the Centaur ‘ Lapithis cratere minantem‚’ G. 2. 456.

7. unde periculum, ‘the danger of whose onset.’ For ‘unde ⁷ used
os persons see on 1. 12. 17.

8. fulgens domus: ⁴ lucidae sedes? 3. 3. 335 ‘ aetheria domus) 1. 3.
29; the δώματα μαρμαίροντα of Homer.

contremuit, with accusative, as Virg. Aen. 3. 648 ‘ sonitumque
pedum vocemque tremisco.’ For the implied comparison os Augustus
and his enemies to Jupiter and the giants see Od. 3. 4. So the ⁶ fulgens
contremuit’ has point as expressing the greatness, magnificence‚ of the
interests threatened.

9. tuque pedestribus. This gives a second reason why Horace
should not attempt the theme. It would not suit his ⁶ iocosa lyra‚' and
Maecenas will treat it better in prose. For ⁴ que ’ in such a case see on
1. 27. 16. Notice the emphatic position of the words which imply the
double opposition between Horace and Maecenas, lyric poetry and
prose. Orelli remarks that Horace is the first of extant Latin writers to
translate the Greek πεζός (Arist. Fr. 713, Plat. Soph. p. 237 A πεζῇ τε
καὶ κατὰ μέτρον).

1 1. per vias, ‘through the streets of Rome‚’ i.e. in a triumph.

12. colla, cp. Prop. 2. 1. 33 (the whole poem presents parallels to this
Ode) ‘Aut regum auratis circumdata colla catenis, Actiaque in Sacra
currere rostra via. ’ So ΕΡο(1.7 ,(7 Intactus aut Britannus ut descenderet
Sacra catenatus via?

minacium, so V; and most of the good MSS. have either this or,
what is only a miswriting of it, ‘minatiumss From this probably arose
