NOTES.

BOOK I.

ODE Ι.

‘Man have different ideas of glory and happiness—success in the
Olympio games, eivic honours, wealth. The sarmer will not turn trader
for any prospect os riches, nor the trader give up the sea for any danger.
One likes a life of ease ; another the excitemeuts of war or sport. My
taste is lyris poetry, and my glory that you should rank me with the
lyric poets of Greece.’

The Ode is clearly written as an introduction. (Cp. the tone of
Od. 3. 30, when the work is done.) It is dedicated to Maecenas—as
is the first of the Epodes, the first of the Satires, the first of B. i. of the
EpistleS. See Introd. to Books i—iii. ξ 11. 2.

Compare also Od. 4. 3, which recalls the main thoughts of this Ode,
though its confident tone and the absence of a patron’s name point the
change which had by that time come upon the poet's circumstances.
There is no need in either Ode to trace the ‘ incongruous ' mention of the
Olympio games as among the natural objeets of ambition to the re-
membrance of any special Greek original, such as Pind. Fr. 201 :—

ἀελλοπύδων μέν τιν’ εὐφραίνωσιν ἵππων
τίμια καῖ στέφανοι τοὺς δ’ ἐν πολυχρύσοις θαλάμοις βιοτά, κ. τ. λ.

The purpose is to give the feeling of a wide survey of human life‚ and
Horace does not draw a strong line between the Greek life which
survived in literature and the actual Roman life of his own day. The
apology for poetry, as one among the various tastes of mankind, is as
old at least as Solon (2. 43—5 2), and Horace would remember the end
ofVirg. G. 2, esp. vv. 503 foll. For the same thoughts in a less poetical
form, cp. Sat. 2. 1. 24 foll. ‘Quot capitum vivunt totidem studiorum
Millia: me pedibus delectat claudere verba, etc?
