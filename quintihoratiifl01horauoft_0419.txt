scilieet, ‘ this is the end of the whole matter? The thirst for money,
which can never be satisfied‚ is the cause to which Horace traces the
cheating os the father and the gambling of the son, and in it he returns
to the lesson of the Ode, of the first line as of the last.

improbam not to be confined to ‘crescunt,’ sor it describes the
nature of wealth‚ which for ever grows, yet comes no nearer to satissying :
it is like a pitcher of the Danaids: τὸ μὲν εὖ πράσσειν ἀκόρεστον ἔφυ

ODE XXV.

In this Ode, as in 2. 19, Horace has tried to catch the inspiration of
a Greek dithyramb. In that one he professes to recall the effeets which
the sight of Bacchus had upon him: in the present one he is actually
under the influence of the afflatus. ‘He is hurried away, whither he
knows not z his eyes are opened on strange caverns and river—banks and
woods. His tongue will be loosed in a moment to sing no humble
theme, and in no common suain, the glories of Caesar: he follows the
god, for he must, and it is delightful‚ but it is fearful too.'

The glory of Caesar is only mentioned as the subject of the coming
burst of song; but the place of honour given to it is in effect the
celebration which is promised. See 1. 6, Introd.

3. velox mente nova. The inspiration so alters him that he can
hardly recognize his soul as his own, and it endows him with the swift-
ness of thought.

‘ meditatur inserere,' etc. The question is where his dreamings will find
voice and an auditory.

skies for ever.’
