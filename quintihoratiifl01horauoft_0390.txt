354 · HORA TI] CARMJNA.

Ode very clear, nor the recita] of Hebrus' accomplishments very appro-
priate. Ritten allowing the whole to be put into Neobule‘s mouth,
makes vv. 4-12 the ‘patruae verbera linguae’ which she imagines to
herself. The uncle, however would hardly spend the greater part of

his scolding 10 praising her lover.
Ges ner follows Acron in taking the whole as ironical, ‘Sotadico

1613511 The idea seems to have arisen from an attempt to interpret the
names, ‘ Hebrus’ (cp. 1. 25. 20) as ‘ Vetulus quidam et odiosus’ ;
‘ Liparaens ’ as ‘ blea1‘-eyed,' ¹ Vulcan-like.’ There are no other indica-
11005 of such a meaning in the Ode.

The verse which Hephaestion quotes, to illustrate the Ionic metre,
from the beginning ofa poem of Alcaeus. ἔμε δεῖλαν ἔμε παισᾶν κακοτάτων
πεδέχοισαν, reads as if Aleaeus’ Ode had been in some way the original
of this one, and it favours also the view that Neobule is speaking in this
Ode of herself.

was a ‘ libertina.’ Perhaps 11 may be better mitigated by observing that
1116 60011051 in Neobule's mind is not so much between one girl and 3
another as between the 101 of women and that of men. The latter have ·
the choice of indulging their love or forgetting it in wine. ‘Poor ⁸
