it, to any legend of two sieges of Troy, but meaning ‘the siege of Troy

it to the special case of Lollius. ‘ The pre-Homerie heroes are dead and
forgotten, and, being forgotten, what difference does it make whether
they were heroes or cowards? We will not allow such a mistake to
occur again now.’ In the words paullum sepultae, ete„ both the par-
ticiples really belong equally to both substantives. ‘ If you hide them
(i.e. do not give them fame through poetry), valour differs little from
cowardiee‚ so soon as they are both in the grave? The appropriation of
