fidissima. .Tuque triceps Hecate quae coeptis conscia nostris Adiu-
trixque venis‚’ Theocr. 2. 10. 12.

arbitrae, in Cicero's sense of ‘witnesses,' Off. 3. 31.

53. in hostiles domos. perhaps only the common formula for ‘ avert
from my home'; cp. Od. ῐ. 21. 15 ‘in Persas atque Britannos‚’ 3. 27.
21. If special ζ enemies' must be found, they will be her rivals in the
love of Varus.

55. formidolosis. The MSS. vary between this reading and the
nominative ‘formidolosae’ B, A, and the Queen's Coll. MS. have the
ablative. Bentley interprets the evidence as to V more fairly than
Keller. Cruquius found. it appears. the ablative in all the Bland MSS„
and with it the annotation ‘propter horrorem noctis et ferarum'3 but
inasmuch as there was also the contradictory annotation which he
prints in the Scholia, ‘timendae quod timorem incutiant‚’ he did not
think it worth while. in a matter of slight importance (⁴ quod parum in-
teresset'l, and where the evidence of his authorities was thus divided,
to alter the received text. If we read the ablative, it will have an active
meaning, as Virg. G. 4. 468 ‘ caligantem nigra formidine silvam! This
is Horace's use of the adjective in Od. 2. 17. 18. If we have the
nominative, it will have a passive sense, ‘timorous‚' as in Ter. Eun. 4. 6.
18, etc. In either case its force seems to lie, as the Scholiast implies, in
its suggestion of the ‘awfulness’ of night, ‘ now that your spell is on
the woods and their inhabitants.' The two verses combine the ideas of
the hour of midnight 'as the time when magic powers are strongest, and
of the lover awake when all the rest of the world is asleep, as Dido in
Virg. Aen. 4. 525 ‘ Dum tacet omnis ager, pecudes pictaeque volucres:
ete.

57—60. The prayer of the next four lines is not quite clear. Why
does she wish the dogs to bark? As a sign that the scented old fop is
coming to her door? or to frighten him from the doors of her rivals as
he comes through the Subura? The first view would be illustrated by
the sign of Daphnis' approach in answer to the spells in Virgil's Phar-
maceutria, E. 8. 107 ⁴ Hylax in limine latrat? The second, however,
gives a better explanation of ‘quod omnes rideant‚' and of the care with
which she has herself prepared the perfumed unguent, which he uses in
his vanity without guessing its purpose. She is meant to make him (and
herself thereby) ridiculous to the reader; but she would not wish him
to be laughed at, except as a means of keeping him to herself.

58. Suburanae. ‘Subura' was the broad hollow formed by the
junction of the valleys between the Quirinal, Viminal‚ and Esquiline
hills, and opening on the Fora. It was a busy part of Rome, but has
a bad name in the poets ; Prop. 4. 7. 15, Mart. 6. 66, Juv. 3. 5.
