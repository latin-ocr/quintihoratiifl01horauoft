‘ arx ’ is ever used simply for ‘ a height ⁷ without a conscious reference, =

whether we take it for the heights behind Tarentum or in its usual ζ i

Horatian sense of the city itself, it is probably intended to suggest also
the idea of a ‘safe retreat‚' a fortress that care cannot storm. Cp. his
inetaphor for his Sabine farm, ‘ubi me in montes et in arcem ex urbe
removi‚' Sat. 2. 6. 16, and possibly the same idea in ‘igneae arces‚' Od.
3. 3. 10. It was the occurrence of the word in this passage probably
that suggested the false reading ‘Aulonisque arces' for ‘Caulonis’ in
Virg. Aen. 3. 553.

oldest MSS. Nothing is known of Pompeius. He has been by some
editors wrongly identified with Pompeius Grosphus, the rich owner of
pastures in Sicily, Epp. 1. 12. 21, Od. 2. 16.

At what point of the civil war Pompeius abandoned it and availed
himself of an offered amnesty, or what interval had elapsed since then,
