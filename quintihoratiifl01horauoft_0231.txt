NOTES. BOOA’l, ODE XIII. 195

47. Iulium sidus, ‘the star os Julius ’ is the same as ‘ Caesaris
astrum) Virg. E. 9. 47, the comet which appeared aster Julius Caesar's
death. Here it stands for the name and greatness of the Julian house.

51. fatis. as osten ‘ sato? The fates are not here personified.

secundo Caesare, ‘ with Caesar for thy vicegerent.'

53—5 7. He—it is only a choice of triumphs, we do not know what the
first will be—shall rule the world.

53. Latio imminentes, For the exaggeration cp. Od. 3. 6. 9—16.

54. iusto, ‘ well earned.‘

55. subiectos, etc„ ‘that border the land of the rising sun'3 so in
Liv. 2. 38. 1 ‘ campus viae subiectus ; ' ‘sub’ of succession.

orae, see on v. 5.

56. Seras, Od. 1. 29. 9, 3. 29. 27, 4. 15. 23. They stand with Horace
sor the peoples of the extreme East. He probably knew nothing of
them except that silk came across Asia from them, Virg. G. 2. 121. As
described by ancient geographers, ‘ Serica ’ is supposed to correspond to
the north-west provinces of the present empire of China.

57. te minor. ⁴ while he bows to thee‚’ Od. 3. 6. 5 ‘ Dis te minorem
quod geris imperas? It is not merely a division of sovereignty, ⁴ Caesar
on earth, Jove in heaven ’ (cp. Od. 3. 5. 1). but the two sovereignties are
connected. The rule of Caesar is the restoration of religion.

latum. The MSS. are fairly divided between ⁸ latum ’ and ⁵ laetum ’ ;
¹ latum' seems to sum up the feeling os the last stanza best; ‘laetum’
would mean ⁶ to‘ its joy.’

59. parurn castis. Lightning striking a place was held to prove
that it had been polluted by some crime, and the spot was covered lest
any should tread on it: Dict. Ant. s. v. ‘bidentaL' and cp. Hor. A. P.
471 ; so that Horace, with a more general meaning, selects a particular
instance, popularly recognised, of the moral government of Jove, ‘ Coelo
tonantem credidimus Iovem Regnare.'

ODE XIII.

‘It is torture to me, Lydia, to hear you sor ever praising Telephus.
Love as passionate and boisterous as his is not the love that lastS.
Happy they that are bound in that true chain Ξ ‘

Metre— T lzz'rd Asclepiad.

Line 1. Telephi . . Telephi, ‘ of Telephus—always Telephus.' The
repetition is emphatic; cp. Epod. 14. 6, and one interpretation of Virg.
E. 7. 70 ‘ Ex illo Corydon Corydon est tempore nobis.' The name of
Telephus recurs in 3. 19. 26 and 4. ι 1. 21, and always of the same ideal
character, a youth, ¹ pu'ro similis vespero‚' whose beauty brings the ladies
