480 ΗΘΚΛ ΤΠ EPODON LIBER,

Methinks 1 see the storm—the sailors toiling and you pale and praying
as the hull goes to pieees. May you be thrown on shore and seed the
cormorants.'

Line 3—8. Contrast Od. 1. 3. 4, ‘Obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga?

10. qua, the antecedent is ‘nocte'3 the night of Orion's setting will ¹
be a stormy one on which the gnidance os the stars would be welcome. ’

Od. 1. 28. 21. 3. 27. 18, Epod. ¹5- 7.

tristis. as ‘tristes Hyadas—x Od. 1. 3. 14.

12. Graia vietorum manus. For the position of the adjective we
may perhaps compare Ι. ²9· 5 ⁵ Quae virginum barbaras

13. 14. For the death of Ajax, the son of Oileus, see Hom. Od. 4.
50² soll.‚ Virg. Aen. 1. 30 soll.

19. Ionius, the lower part of the Adriatic. Maevius is crossing to
Greece.

21. opima, ⁴ apparet et pinguem eum fuisse‚' Porph.

22. iuverit. This is the reading of all the older MSS. and of Acron
and Porphyrion. Many editors have received ‘ iuveris' on the authority
of the Comm. Crnq., who explains it by ‘paveris' If we retain the
third person, ⁴ praeda ⁹ is the direct subject.

23, ²4· The sacrifices usually offered for the preservation of mariners
he vows if Maevius suffers shipwreck. Virg. Aen. 5. 772 ‘Tempesta-
tibus agnam Caedere deinde iubet?

EPODE XI.

‘I have no heart for poetry. A different passion has smitten me.
I am the victim of Love in a way that no one else is. Three years ago
it was Inachia. 1 was the talk of the town: my moody ways, my loud
complaints that she preferred money to inerit, my resolutioris to free
myself, and my repented return to slavery. Now it is another. Neither
advice nor rebuffs will cure me. The only relies that I can look for is
some new passion.'

Horace, as Ritter remarks, turns the sting of his iambic verse, in
profession at least, upon himself. We know no more of his friend
Pettius (or Pectius as some MSS. spell ·it), to whom the Epode is
addressed.

Mene—Anln'loclzinm HIm.
Line 2. versiculos, the diminutive gives a touch of ironical contempt,

as in Sat. 1. 10. 58.
amore percussum, probably a reminiscenee of Lucretius, 1. 922
