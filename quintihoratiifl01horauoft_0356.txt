320 HORA Tll CARMMM.

vagus, πολύπλαγκτος, Virg. Aen. 6. 801 ‘Nec vero Alcides tantum
telluris obivit,' where note that the travels of Hercules and Bacchus are
mentioned to be compared with the progress of Augustus in the East.

10. enisus, so the best MSS. (including V) against ‘innisrrsl It is
the usual word for struggling upwards‚ as Yirg. G. 2. 560, os the climb-
ing vine. ,

arces igneas, for the meaning of ‘arces’ see on 2. 6. 22: ‘ ignea&
¹ starry,' as Horace calls the stars ‘ ignes,’ Od. 1. 12. 47 3 Ovid‘s ‘siderea
a1·x‚' Am. 3. 10. 21.

attigit, see on 1. 3. 10.

12. purpureo ore, as ‘roseo ore' of Venus, Virg. Aen. 2. 593: though
attributed to only one feature, it implies the halo of rosy light which
surrounds the beatitied Augustus. ‘Candidus insuetum miratur limen
Olympi‚’ Virg. E. 5. 56, of the apotheosis of Daphnis.

bibit, al. ‘bibet' The MSS. are fairly divided. Of the Scholiasts,
Aer. interprets the future. Porph.‚ though his lemma has the present,
does not indicate the tense in his interpretation. Either readingis in-
telligible. If we accept ¹ bibet ' Horace will represent a placeas already
] repared at the banquet of the gods and waiting for Augustus, as Virgil,
G. 1. 24 soll. ‘Tuque adeo quem mox quae sint habitura deorum Con-
cilia incertum est‚’ ete. Virgil’s ‘mox' (see Conington in loc.) and
‘ Iampridem nobis caeli te regia, Caesar, Invidet‚’ G. 1. 503, may answer
the objection raised to the future by Orelli, that the mention of death,
even under the form of a promise of immortality, would not be a pleas-
ing compliment. The stress is laid on the deificati0n;· death, as a
necessary preliminary, is lost to sight. ‘Bibas however, which makes
Augustus a ⁶ praesens deus,' already living on earth the life of a god, is
more in accordance with Horace's usual language; see especially Qd.
4. 5. 31—36, and the passage already quoted from Epp. 2. 1. 15 foll.
‘ Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores Iurandasque tuum per nomen
ponimus aras.' It is more likely also to have been altered, as the more
extravagant‚ especially to ears familiar with the Christian conception of
life aster death. But Horace's own transfiguration in Od. 2. 20, and the
beatification given by the Muse to Romulus and Hercules and the
Dioscuri in 4. S are metaphors of fame, not forms of a future life.

14. vexere, evidently, from the context, in his triumphal ascent to
heaven. Compare Propertius’ account (3. 17. 8) of the apotheosis of
Ariadne, ‘Lyncibus in caelum vecta Ariadna tuis.’ The tamed tigers
are not only an ornamental appendage‚ they are emblems of the civilizing
labours, his ‘just purpose firmly l<ept,' whereby he merited deification.
These are recognized also probably in the ‘pater,' although this was
a common address to the Roman gods. Cp. Od. 1. 18. 6, Epod. 2. 22,
Epp. 1. 16. 59, 2. 1. 5, and see Conington on Virg. G. 2. 4.
