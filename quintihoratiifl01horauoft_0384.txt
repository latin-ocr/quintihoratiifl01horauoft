348 ΗΘΚΛ TII CARMJNA.

10. citharae seiens; 1. 15. ²4 ‘pugnae sciens?

12. animae, ‘her life,’ Orelli; probably better with Ritter‚ ‘my
life: i.e. Chloe. Cp. ⁶ Meae partem animae? 2. 17. 5 and 1. 3. 8.

14. Thurini filius Ornyti; see Introd. to 2. 4. The fulness of the
designation is probably, as Ritter points out, as much as to say, ‘He is
a real person. I can tell you all about him if you wish, as well as you
can tell me of Chloe and her charms.’ Cp. 3. 12. 6. Thurii seems to
be selected for its old reputation of wealth and luxury; the others are
mythological names, chosen ‘ ut poetica et sonora,' Orelli. ‘ Ornytus'
is used by Virg. Aen. 11. 677.

16. puero. It is not quite easy to see the point of Lydia's variation
from ‘animae’ It may be merely for variety’s sake. Possibly, how-

. ever, ‘animae,' taken in connection with the early lines of the stanza,

which had not touched a very deep chord, might have seemed conven-

18. iugo aeneo, Ι. 33. 11, of its strength3 ‘irrupta copula‚’ 1.
13. 18.

cogit, ‘brings together-,⁷ Virg. Aen. 7. 639 has ‘ad iuga cogit
equos.’

19. excutitur, is (lislodged from her influence over my heart. Virg.
Aen. 5. 679 ‘excussaque pectore Iuno est’; or, as Bentley thinks, ‘from
my house‚' so as to correspond with ‘ patet ianua Lydiae.' It is hard to
be sure of the exact metaphor felt in ‘excutitur‚' or even whether it and
‘ patet ianua' are either or both of them metaphorical.

20. Lydiae, the dative, not the genitive, as it has been taken.

21. sidere pulchrior3 3. 19. 26 ‘ Puro te similem, Telephe, vespero?
Astyanax in Hom. Il. 6. 401 is ἐναλίγκιος ἀστέρι καλῷ.

23. iracundior. His levity and his passionate temper have both
been shown in the quarrel which is being made up. If we were to
identify the interlocutor with Horace himself, we might remember his

description of himself Epp. 1. 20. 25 ‘Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis
essem!

Hadriam 1.33. 15.
ODE X.

What the Greeks called a παρακλαυσίθυρον. Other specimens may be
seen and compared in Theoc. 3. 23 soll.‚ Propert. 1. 16. 17 foll. Cp.
also Horace, Od. 1. 25. 6-8, 3. 7. 29 soll.

The poet personates a lover singing under his mistress’ window on a
srosty night, and appealing to her pity to let him in. ‘Venus will
resent and punish your pride; you have no right from your origin to
give yourself the airs of a Penelope. Though no human feelings—gra-
