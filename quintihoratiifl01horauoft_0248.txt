‘nimio plus‚' Cic. ad Att. 10. 8. It has been explained: (Ι) as a¹
translation of ὑπεράγαν, following the analogy of ‘ plus justo,’ ete.‚
‘ more than that which is too 1nueh’; (2) as following the analogy of
‘plus paulo’ (‘ a little too much ’), Ter. Heaut. 2. 1. 8; ’nimio vali-
(lius,¹ Plin. 24. 12; ‘ nimio melius‚' Plaut. Pers. 1. 3. 31, ‘by very much
too mueh'; ‘nimio ' being the ablative or adverb of measure. It is a
colloquial phrase common in Plautus, M. G. 2. 6. 106, Bacch. 1. 2. 42,
and the combination in Bacch. 4. 4. 21 ‘nimio minus, multo parum‚’
seems to show that the second explanation was the true one; see a
collection of instanees of ‘nimio' with compar. adj. in Ramsay's
‘ Mostellaria,' Excursus 12. 1t qualifies ‘tollens,’ ⁸ lifting far too high ’;
with this picture cp. Od. 3. 16. 17 ‘ Iure perhorrui Late conspicuum
tollere verticem?

Gloria, ‘vainglory,' as in Epp. 1. 18. 22 ‘ Gloria quem supra vires
et vestit et ungit.’

16. arcani Fides proffiga, an oxymoron, ¹ Faith, that blabs out her
secret' ; cp. Od. 3. 24. 59 ‘periura fides)

perlucidior vitro, ‘ with a window in its mind‚' Con. Compare the
Greek proverbs‚ κάτοπτρον εἴδους χαλκός ἐστ’ οἶνος δὲ νοῦ and τὸ ἐν
καρδίᾳ τοῦ νήφοντος ἐπὶ τῇ ’γλώσσῃ τοῦ μεθύοντος, Hor. Epod. 11. 14,
S. 1. 4. 89.

ODE XIX.

² Ι thought my days of passion were over, but love and wine and
idleness and Glycera's beauty are too much sor me. Again I feel the
sun power of Venus—again must leave all other subjects to wn'te love
songs—again think only of propitiating Venus and moderating the
pains os my passion.'

See Introd. to Ode 4. 1, which Horace links to this Ode by repeating
the first line.

Metre* T lz im' A sclcy’iad.

Line 1. saeva, ‘ imperious? ⁶ Saeva Proserpina‚' Od. 1. 28. 203
‘ saeva Necessitas‚’ 1. 35. 17.

2. Semelae. It is needless to write ‘Semeles' against the nearly
unanimous authority of the MSS„ although Horace more usually prefers
a Greek form in the Odes. Comp. Helenae, Od. Ι. 3. 2, with Helenen,
1. 15. 2, Helene, 4. 9. 16.

3. Licentia, ‘ freedom of life,' as Catullus, 51. 13, traces his passion
to ⁴ otium,’ ‘ Otium Catulle tibi molestum est‚' ete.

5. nitor, Od. 5. 12. 5 ‘Liparaei nitor Hebri‚’ ‘bright beauty.''

S. lubricus, a face to look on which is to slip from your resolve.
