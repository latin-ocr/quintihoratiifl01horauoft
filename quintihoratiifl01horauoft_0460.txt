ODE VII.

‘Spring has returned to earth, and with it foliage and light and warmth.
lt will not las t for ever: this is the lesson of rev olvingt> seasons. Only
tlz’) pass to return again3 ‘1032 when we pass where the great and good
are gone before us, are dust and nothing. To-day may be your last;
who knows? Take your fill of enjoyment. &Wiat you spend on yoursels
is at least 5ο much the less for your greedy heir. When once you are
dead and passed Minos' grand tribunal, neither race, Torquatus, nor 1
eloquence, nor goodness, will restore you to the light. Think of
Hippolytus and Pirithous, and leam this lesson from their fate?

Torquatus' is the same person, doubtless‚ whom Horace addressed· ιι]
Epp. 1. ‚to much the same purpose as in this Ode: but more than
that it is ἰΗόἰῗίἦςιιὴ to say, notwi hstanding the many guesses that have
been offered on the subject. The two most plausible ones are, (1) that
of Estre, who identifies with him the Aulus Torquatus mentioned in
Corn. Nep. Atticus, as among those who were compromised by their
share in Brutus and Cassius' campaign. This would give an occasion
for Horace's acquaintance with him, though the prominence which is
given to him will hardly suit a man of Horace's own age or rank.
