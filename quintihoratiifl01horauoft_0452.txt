4 1 6 HORA TII CARMJNA.

58. nigrae ; 1. 21. 9. See there also for Mt. Algidus: its holm-oaks
are celebrated in 3. 23. 10.

feraci frondis, as ⁶ fecunda culpae secula,’ 3. 5. 17; cp. C. S. 19.

50, 60. The subject of ⁶ (lucit ’ is ⁴ gens‚’ but here, as commonly in
Horace (see on 1. 35. 19, 2. 2. 1, 4. 2. 7), the interpretation cannot
shake itself clear of the language of the allegory. ‘ For every bough it
loses‚ for every cut the knife gives it, aye, from the very edge of the
steel itself, draws fresh power and spirit.' ‘Opes’ and ‘animus,' or
‘ animi‚’ were joined in this way almost proverbially‚ Virg. Aen. 2. 799,
Caes. B. G. 7. 76. A few MSS. read ‘ animos ' here, but Horace seems
purposely to vary the termination.

61. The stanza has been pronounced an interpolation by Meineke
and other erities, on the ground of its introduction of mythological lore,
which seemed to thern frigid, and such as we find rather in Propertius and
in the Alexandrine poets. Horace possibly had in mind the saying of
Pyrrhus recorded by Florus, 1. 18 ‘Video me (inquit) plane Herculis
sidere procreatum, cui quasi ab angue Lernaeo tot caesa hostium capita
de sanguine suo renascantur.’

firmior. The adjective is more appropriate to the resolution of the
Roman people, and the firm front of their legions, than to the hydra;
but, in reference to it, it would seem to be antithetical to ‘secto corpore,'
and to mean ⁵ sounder'; when he slashed its body it faced him in a
moment entire as before.

62. vinci dolentem, ‘chafing at the f0i1,' Conington. It is the
measure of the unexpected persistence of the foe.

63. monstrum, of the arnied warriors that sprang from the dragon's
teeth‚ sown by Jason in the furrows which the sire>breathing bulis had
ploughed (Ov. Met. 7. 121 soll), or by Cadmus at Thebes (Ov. Met. 3.
24 solt). So new soldiers seem to spring from the earth for Rome.

submisere3 Luer. 1. 8 ‘tellus submittit flores.'

Colchi, of the country, as ‘ Sabini) 3. 4. 21, etc.

64. Echioniae, in reference to the particular story, for Echion was
one of the five of the Sparti who survived the mutual slaughter; Ov.
Met. 3. 126.

65. merses, ‘ plunge it if you will.' For the construction cp. Epp.
1. 10. 24. Some good MSS. (including Ber-n.) have the corruption
‘ mersus‚' which, as Bentley points out, is impossible, since ‘ gens’ must
be the subject. Ritter thinks this line and the next have a definite his-
torical reference to the disasters of the Romans by sea in the First Punic
VVar, and on land in the Second, and their subsequent recovery in each
case. With the thoughts of the stanza compare the sayings attributed
to Hannibal by Livy (27. 14). ‘cum eo nimirum hoste res estqui nec
bonam nee malam ferre fortunam potest. Seu vicit, ferociter instat
