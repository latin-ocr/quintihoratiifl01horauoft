gested the idea, which it often conveys, of poetical composition as the
means os confer-ring the promised glory: ‘meditari’ is used in the sense

of ‘ composing aloud' in Virg. E. 6. 82 ‘Omnia quae Phoebo quondam
meditante beatus Audiit Eurotas?

6. consilio Iovis, ‘the council board of Jupiter.’ Virgil’s ‘quem
mox quae sint habitura deorum Concilia,' G. 1. 24, is hardly as high a
compliment to Augustus’ wisdom. Bentley would follow a minority os
MSS. in reading ‘concilio’ here also; but Orelli points out that as
‘ concilium ' means only a ‘ gathering‚' ‘concilium deorum ' is a natural
expression, ‘ concilium Iovis ' scarcely so. The general terms in which
Caesar's apotheosis is spoken of are the same in the two passages. In
both he is at one moment to be a god, at another a star.

7. The subject of his song is to be something notable, something
new, something which no tongue has sung of before him.

reeens implies that the events are fresh.

8. non secus, etc. As the Bacchante who has been carried by her
frenzy to the top of Haemus (cp. Lucan. 1. 673 ‘vertice Pindi Edonis
Ogygio decurrit plena Lyaeo ¹) gazes in rapt astonishment on the plain
of Thrace before her, the Hebrus watering the middle of it, Rhodope
its western boundary‚—so the poet, carried he knows not where (‘devio’),
looks with delighted wonder on river-banks and woodland. The two
points of comparison are the unexpectedness of the sight, and its effect
in rousing further the Bacchic or the poetic ἐνθουσιασμός. Thrace is
sacred land to the Bacchante, the woods and streams to the poet, 3. 4.
5 soll, 4. 3. 10.

9. exsomnis; Soph. Ant. 1152 Θυίαισιν αἵ σε μαινόμεναι πάννυχοι
χορεύουσι. The epithet indicates her excitement. Bentley, objecting
that the Bacchae are spoken of by Euripides (Bacch. 682) and other

poets as sleeping, and that ‘ iugis⁷ requires an epithet‚ needlessly alters Ἴ ¹

‘exsomnis’ to ‘Edonis‚' and he is followed by Meineke, Haupt, and
Dillr.

11. pede barbaro. The point of the epithets is the desolation or
savagery of the view; they correspond to the ‘vacuum nemus,’ cf. v. 133 -
there is room there sor the god and for the museS.

12. ut, constr. after ‘non secus.' Bentley, doubting the possibility
of this constr. and yet wishing to connect the two sentences (others take
‘ut’ as exchmatory), would read with a few MSS. ‘ ac’ ; but Horace
uses ‘ut’ where ‘ac ’ is more usual3 cp. 1. 16. 7, 9 ‘aeque . . ut.'

14. Naiadum potens, 1. 3. 1.

¹5· valentium3 Eur. Bacch. 109, 1064, 1098. A comparison is
evidently intended between the supernatural strength given to the
Bacchantes by the possession of the god and the power to sing ‘nil
parvum nil mortale,’ which the same inspiration gives to the poet.
