ODE XVI.

‘ Fair daughter of a mother sair, though not so fair as you, bum and
forget my scurrilous iambics. Passion is as resistless as the afflatus of
Cybele. or Apollo, or Bacchus. We are all liable to it, we all have our
share of the lion's heart. You may read its effects in all story. Curb
your passion; I too was led astray by it. Forgive me, accept my
palinode and be my friend?

‘ Tyndaridi satisfacit . . Imitatus est Stesichomm poetam Siculum qui
vituperationem Helenae scribens caecatus est et postea responso Apolli-
nis laudem eius scripsit et oculorum aspectum recepit, cuius rei etin
Epodo poeta idem meminit 1—-

‘Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice
Fraterque magni Castoris victi prece
Adempta vati reddidere lumina.' Acron.

⁴ Hac ode παλινῳδίαν repromittit ei in quam probrosum carmen scripserat
Tyndaridi amicae suae! Porph.

In aecordance with this the Ode is headed in the MSS. B and A ‘ad
Tyndariden.²

‘Cantat palinodiam, i.e. cantando revocat quae scripserat iratus in
amicam Gratidiam,³ Comm. Cruq. And so some MSS. head it ⁴ Palin-
odia Gratidiae.' ’ Others unite the two views, and identisy ‘ Tyndaris'
with ‘ Gratidia' or ‘ Canidia ' ; ⁶ Palinodia Gratidiae vel Tyndaridis)

For the first view, which identifies the unknown object of this palinode
with the Tyndaris of the following Ode, there seems to be no external
argument. There was the temptation to connect the two Odes, to make
the invitation of that the complement of the reeonciliation in this; and
the connection of the name of Helen on the one side with the name of
Tyndaris, and on the other with the original ‘palinode‚’ would easily
suggest to ingenious Scholiasts the desired link.

With respect to the second view the case is not so clear. If the
‘criminosi iambi' here recanted are to be looked sor among Horace's
extant poems, they can hardly be other than his attacks on Canidia in
Epodes 5 and 17. To our ideas it is a slight recantation for such a
libel, so much so that it might seem to force us to give both to the
Epodes and to Sat. 1. 8 less reality than we should naturally give. There
is no bitterness in this Ode, nothing which would justify us in holding
(for this is one suggestion) that it is a continuation of the libel⁷ the ‘tu
pudica, tu proba' which he offered to sing, ‘ mendaci lyra,’ ⁵ tuning his
harp to salseh00d‚’ in Epod. 17. 59; but yet the tone of the palinode is
barely serious. There is a mock heroic air in the ‘ urbes altae‚'‘ Thyestes‚'
⁶ Prometheus’ (comp. Od. 2. 4, 4. 11. ²5 foll„ and Epod. 3). It is intended,
