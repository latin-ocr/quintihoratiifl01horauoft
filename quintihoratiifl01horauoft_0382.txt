346 HORA TII CARMJNA.

ac, 66, the year before Horace's birth. Cp. 3. 21. 1 ‘ O nata mecum
Consule Manlio.' This was not an extreme age (cp. 3. 14. 13 ⁴ Cadum
Marsi memorem duelli‚’ i.e. as old as nnc. 88), and the occasion demands
the oldest wine in the cellar. Another L. Volcatius Tullus was consul
with Augustus in nc. 33.

13. amici, the genitive of the person in whose honour the cup is
drunk. Cp. 3. 19. 9 soll. ‘ Da lunae propere novae, Da noctis mediae,
da, puer, auguris Murenae? The custom and the construction are
Greek. Theoc. 14. 18 ἔδοξ’ ἐπιχεῖσθαι ἄκρατον ’Ώτινος ἤθελ’ ἕκαστος,
ἔδει μόνον ὥτινος εἷπῆν. Orelli quotes also Antiph. in Athen. 10. 21
κυάθους θεῶν τε καὶ θεαινῶν μυρίους. This illustrates also ‘centum'
for an indefinite number. Macleane, referring to the custom mentioned
in Ov. Fast. 3. 531 foll. (‘ Sole tamen vinoque calent, annosque precan-
tur Quod sumunt calices, ad numerumque bibunt. Invenies illic qui
Nestoris ebibat annos, Quae sit per calices facta Sibylla su0s‚’), thinks it
is equivalent to saying. ⁶ wish me a hundred years of life?

14. vigiles, to keep the banquet up all night; 1⁴ 27. 5, 3. 21. ²3
⁶ vivae lucernae ’; Virg. Aen. 9. 338 ‘Aequasset nocti ludum in lucem—
que tulisset! Orelli contrasts the expression of Ov. Her. 19. 195 ‘iam
dormitante lucerna.’

15, 16. ⁶ It shall be a sober and peaceful merrymaking’ ; no ‘impius
clam01·,' 1. 27· 7 3 no ‘male ominata verba? 3. 14. 11. The purpose is
apparently to make more alluring to Maecenas the contrast from the
tumults and troubles of the city. Perhaps also to give something of a
religious air to the banquet of thanksgiving.

17. civiles = ‘clomcsticas,’ opposed to the foreign questions of the
following lines.

super urbe3 Virg. Aen. 4. 233 ‘ Nec super ipse sua molitur laude
laborem.’ For the reference see Introd. to Books i-iii. ξ 8.

18. Daci Cotisonis; see lntrod. to Books i-iii. ξ 7.

19. Medus, ‘the Parthian'; see on 1. 2. 22. The point that the
Mede's whole ofsensive power is exhausted on himself in intestine
quarrels is brought out by the position of ⁵ sibi ’ standing where it seem's
equally open to be governed by ‘infestuS‚’ ‘luctuosis,' and ‘dissidet.’
See on 1. 3. 6.

21. vetus hostis; Od. τ. 6. 2, 4. 14. 41, Epp. 1. 12. 26.

23. laxo arcu3 Virg.Aen. 11. 874, of retreat, ‘laxos referunt humeris
languentibus arcus? The Scythians are thinking of retiring from the
plains which they have been accustomed to harry. Cp. 2. 9. 23.

25. neglegens, ‘Be careless for a time; be a private citizen: spare
thy over-anxiety lest in any way the people should take harm.’ ⁶ Ne
laboret' seems to be constructed‚ in Horace's manner, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with
‘neglegens’ (=‘n0n curans ') and ‘cavere’ Orelli, Ritter, and Dillr.
