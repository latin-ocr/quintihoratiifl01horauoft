to a level with ‘ plebs ' as a synonym for the ‘ many’ when contrasted ¹]
with the ‘ few‚' whether of wealth, birth, or intellect. Α

2. morte venalem. Maeleane well quotes Aesch. in Ctes. ξ 160
αἵματός ἐστιν ἡ ἀρετὴ amia: ⁶ morte’ meaning here, as αἵματος there, not
necessarily the shedding of one's blood, but the risk of shedding it: cp.
⁴ mortemque volunt pro laude pacisci,’ Virg. Aen. 5. 230. χ

5. unjoo gaudens marito, ‘ whose whole joy is in her husband' ; so ;

Orelli, as though in identisying Livia the poet intended to compliment ’ .
her as a Roman matron of the old type of conjugal loyalty. He objeets i

to Ritter's rendering of ὅ unico’ as=⁶ egregio‚' that this would antici-
pate and reduce to a bathos the epithet ⁶ clari ducis.’ That the refer-
ence is to Livia, not to faithful wives generally, is clear from the mention
ofAugustus’ sister in v. 7. ,

6. operata, probably to be taken as ‘solata’ in Virg. G. 1. 293 (see ⁴

Conington's note) as a present participle, ‘come forth and sacn'fice? ¹

For ‘operari' in this technical sense, like ⁶ facere‚’ ῥέζειν, cp. Virg. G.
1. 339 ⁴ Sacra refer Cereri laetis operatus in herbis.’

divis. This was the reading of Acr. and Porph.‚ who interpret
‘iustis divis‚’ sc. ‘qui Caesari victoriam et reditum merenti dederunt!
The balance of older MSS. is in favour of ⁴ sacris,' which Orelli and
Ritter retain. Bentley shows that both constructions os ‘operari’ are

equally legitimate. ⁶ Iustis sacris ' would mean ‘ duly performed,’ and, if ¹⁴

we take ‘unico gaudens marito’ with Orelli, must be connected with

those words3 ‘mulier pudica atque igitur propter ipsam castimoniam ¹

digna quae votum pro reditu mariti solvat sacris iustis, sc. legitimis.'

8. supplice vitta3 Virg. Aen. 4. 657 ‘ipsa pia tege tempora vitta.’ ¹
This seems distinct from its ordinary use, by freeborn maids and matrons, ¹
to confine the hair. ’

 

, 9, 10. virginum . . puellae, of young wives, cp. 2. 8. 22, 3. 22. 2. g
The matrons are bidden to assist Livia and Octavia in the religious rites. 1
The returning soldiers and the young wives to whom they are returning >

are bidden εὐφημεῖν, to keep a sacred silence, or not to interrupt the
ceremony by too noisy delight.

11. male ominatis, δυσφήμοις. This was the reading of V, and ap· ¹

parently of the original text which Acr. and'Porph. interpreted (⁶ ne
incaute loquentes verbis omina facerent ⁹), although ‘nominatis' (the
reading of Β) stands in their present text. It seems to be true, as Bent-
ley argues, that no other instance can be quoted of a hiatus between a
short and a long vowel when there is no natural break in the line (un-
less we retain and argue upon the generally abandoned reading ‘ horri-
bilesque ultimosque Britannos' of Catull. 11. 11), and such compounds
as ‘suax·e01ens,’ ‘graveolens‚' etc.‚ usually lose the ‘ e’ in scansion. On
the other hand, while the temptation would be strong to remedyan
