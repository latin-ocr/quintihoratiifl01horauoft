ride in triumph on your neck. Ι can call the moon from the sky and
raise the dead from their urns. Do you think 1 can’t deal with you ?'

Under the form of a recantation offered by himself and rejected by
Canidia, he repeats and aggravates the attacks upon her of Epod. 5 and
Sat. 1. 8. Her witchcraft is taken for granted by both speakers. New
or more definite charges are made against her, though they are put in
the form ‘you did not,⁷ etc. She allows every charge, and is angry
only at their disclosure. The tone is more personal than before. It is
no longer Varus or some unnamed victim of her spells, but Horace
(see esp. V. 58), and it gives an interpretation to the other two poems.
Ifthey had stood alone we might have thought that it was a class, or
a public folly, that he was assailing. But here we can hardly doubt
that we have a personal enmity, involving more or less of real bitter-
ness, and expressed under a form more or less allegorieal. It is impos-
sible to read the riddle completely. Horace doubtless dramatizes
imaginary situations, but it is not in his way to sustain an imaginary
character through three entire poems, besides making it the object of
allusions in several others. Cp. Epod. 3. 8, Sat. 2. 1. 48, 2. 8. 95, and
see Introd. to Od. 1. 16. This Epode is posterior to Epod. 5 and Sat.
1. S, for it contains references to them; see vv. 47-52, 58.
