232 HORATJJ CARMJNA.

‘ Orco demittere ' is a Virgilian phrase representing Homer's Ἀἵδι προϊάπ-
τειν, For the dat. see on Od. 1. 24. 18.

14. iudice te. As addressed to Archytas this is simple, and the
case of Pythagoras is a natural climax. Those who put the words into
Archytas' mouth are driven either to alter, with Jani, ‘ 16 ’ to ‘ me‚’ or to
suppose that Archytas presumes in all the world the same reverence for
his master that he seels himself.

auctor, ‘master-,³ ‘teacher‚' Cic. ad Att. 7. 3 ‘auctor Latinitatis';
Virg. Aen. 11. 339 ‘ consiliis habitus non sutilis auctor!

15. sed, advers* to the last clause. He may have been a great phi-
losopher, but he was a man, and death knows no exceptions.

16. via leti, the same image, Od. 2. 17. 1 1 ⁶ supremum carpere iter?

17 foll. On Dillenburger's theory, Archytas' answer begins here.
The sailor has insisted on the universality of death by the argument
that those do not escape whom you would most expect 10 escape.
⁴ Yon, the philosopher5‚ do not escape.' Archytas is supposed to bring
the same lesson home to the sailor by another argument. ‘The forms
and occasions of death are many3 your own trade has its dangers; the
young (116 as well as 1116 old ; the only fixed thing is that all die. I died
like the rest, cast ashore, as you might be, by a tempest. Be not in
such a hurry after your gain as to refuse me the last rites. You will
not be unpunished if you do.’

17. spectacula. The metaphor is from gladiatorial shows: wars
are the ‘ludi' in which Mars delights‚ Od. 1. 2. 37. The Furies are
represented as stirring up war in Virg. Aen. 7. 324 sou„ 12. 845 foll.

18, avidum, a few MSS. read ‘ avidis ’; but even ifwe want, as we do
on Dillenburger’s interpretation, a hit at the trader's eagerness for gain,
‘ avidis' is neither so delicate nor so sorcible as ‘ midam? which means
‘greedy as they ’3 cp. Od. 2. 18. 30 ‘rapacis Orci‚’ where the epithet is
clearly meant 10 compare the greediness of death for his prey with the
greediness os the rich landlord who is laying field to field.

20. saeva, Od. 1. 19. Ι, perhaps with a reminiscence of the Homeric
epithet, [ἐπ]αινὴ Περσεφόνεια.

eaput fugit. None could die (acc. to Virg. Aen. 4. 698) till Proser-
pine had cut a lock of hair from his head 3 the idea being that the dying
man was a victim offered to the powers below (⁴ victima Orci‚' Od. 2. 3.
245, as it was usual to begin a sacrifice by cutting some hairs from the
sorehead of the victim and burning them, Virg. Aen. 6. 245. Cp. Eur.
Alc. 74. where Θάνατος says, στείχω δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν ὡς κατάρξωμαι ξίφει· Ι
ἱερὸς ’γὰρ οὗτος τῶν κατὰ χθονὸς θεῶν Ι ὅτου τόδ’ ἔγχος κρατὸς ἁγνίσῃ
τρίχα.

fugit. The perf. tense, as Od. 2. 13. 20 ‘leti vis rapuit rapietque
gentes.'
