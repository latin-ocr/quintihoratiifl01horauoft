ODE IV.

‘ Calliope, aid me in my song. Is it a delusion, or am I already among
the Muses hearing and seeing them? I am their savourite. In my
childhood the wood-pigeons covered me with leaves when I was asleep
on the hillside, and through lise the Muses have given me a special pro—
tection. For their love Ι escaped Philippi, and the falling tree, and
shipwreck off Palinurus. And they are Caesar's solace and resreshment
too. They give him gentle counsels, and he accepts them. &We all
know how Jove's holt swept away the brutal Titans3 for all their
strength of arm, and piled mountains and uprooted trees, they could
not stand against Pallas and the gods who ranged themselves around
her. Strength without mind falls of its own weight; strength, tempered
with moderation, the gods advance and protect. The giants are in
Tartarus, and will never be released. Lawless lust is punished with
endless chains?

This Ode deals with the side of the imperial reigime which probably
did most to attract and hold fast such adherents as Horace himself. The
Muses themselves ‘gave gentle counsels to Caesar.‘ It was the re'gime
of moderation, of refinement, of literary culture. Those who still con—
tinued to conspire against this gentle rule were as the giants trying to
overthrow the Olympian gods, and restore the dominion of insensate
force and lawless lust. But force without wisdom is powerless.

quite perfect. There are not three choices offered, as might appear,
the pipe, or the voice, or the stringed instruments, but (as Ritter points
out) two. The voice will be used in any case; the alternative is
between two tones os the voice and two several accompaniments which
suit them. Horace asks first that the melody shall be on the pipe; he
corrects this, and laying the emphasis on ‘ longum,' leaves it to Calliope
(so long as in this respect it is such as he asks for) to decide whether it
shall be ‘ voce acuta ' (and so accompanied hythe pipe) or ‘ voce gravi ’
<and so accompanied by the stringcd instrument). There is the same
