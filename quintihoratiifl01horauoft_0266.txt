occasion when Horace was staying there. He has been drowned on the
Illyrian shore (v. 22), but his shade revisits Tarentum, apostrophizes
Archytas, whose tomb is placed there, and appearing to a sailor, bids
him stop on his voyage to throw dust on its unburied corpse‚ as he
hopes for a prosperous return to more western waters (v. 26).

Others have supposed that the imaginary corpse is Horace‘s own.
He had been nearly lost at sea once off Cape Palinurus (Od. 3. 4. 28).
The scenery of this Ode will hardly suit that occasion3 but the event
may have filled his mind with thoughts and images of shipwreck.

In my notes Ι have inclined to Dillenburger's interpretation, not as
a completely satisfactory one, but as less sar-setehed than most, and
involving fewer difficulties, and as giving the Ode a thoroughly Horatian
tone. That Archytas had a tomb on the sea-coast, near Mount Gar-
ganus, is not a fact of history, nor in any way less an assumption of the
interpreter than that he was drowned and cast ashore there.

We may notice that Horace seems to have been interested in the
Pythagoream doctrines, and especially in that of Metempsychosis, and
yet not disinclined to speak playfully of them, Epod. 15. 21, Epp. 2. Ι.
52, S. 2. 6. 62. He ranks Pythagoras with Socrates and Plato as repre-
senting ‘the great teachers of Greek philosophy, S. 2. 4. 3.

Archytas was a Greek of Tarentum, and lived in the fourth century

ΒΕ. Like the rest of the Pythagorean school of philosophers he was a
great mathematician.

Line Ι. maris et terrae. Horace combines the title οἷ’γεωμέτρης with
the charge of counting the sand which exceeds number. He is thinking
probably of the ψαμμὶτης of Archimedes, the responsibility of which he
throws on Archytas as a kindred genius, The question with Archimedes
was not really the number of the saud, but the possibility of expressing
numbers which defied the capacity of the clumsy Greek notation;
though his treatise starts as an answer to those who had asserted that
the number of the sand on the shores of Sicily was infinite, or at least
incapable of arithmetica] expression. ‘To count the sand ⁷ was a proverb
for wasted trouble, Pind Ol. 13. 66, Virg. G. 2. 104, so that the speaker
is intended (as the oxymoron ‘mensorem . . numero carentis' suggests)
to put Archytas' labours in a somewhat ridiculous light.

2. combent, ‘ confine,' κατέχει. The contrast is, of course, between
he infinity of space and number through which Archytas ranged in
life, and the tiny handful of dust which has set bounds to him and his
thoughts now.
