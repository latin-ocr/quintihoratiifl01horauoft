ODES, BOOKS J-JJI. 5

at Tarraco for some months. In the meantime the war was
concluded by C. Antistius and T. Carisius, his ‘legati.' Augus-
tus himself returned home in ΒΕ. 24. ln the same year they rose
again (Dio. 53. 28) and seized by stratagem and killed some
Roman soldiers, but were again put down by L. Aemilius.

The expressions of Od. 2. 6. 2 ‘Cantabrum indoctum iuga
ferre nostra,⁷ and 2. 11. 1 ⁴ Quid bellicosus Cantaber . . . cogitet‚²
would be intelligible at any time during this period, and as each
conquest would be thought final till the next rising, there is
nothing in the words of 3. 8. 21 (‘ Servit Hispanae vetus hostis
orae Cantaber sera domitus catena ²) to fix them necessarily to
a single date. Other considerations place the Ode, as we shall
see, either in B.C. 29 or in 23. ν

The final subjugation of the Cantabri by Agrippa in 'B.C. 19
(Dio 54. 11) does not come within the period of Odes i-iii,
but is recorded in Epp. 1. 12. 26, and alluded to in Od. 4.
14. 41.

ᾧ 7. Daci, Gelae, Scythae, Gel0nz·.—There is much vagueness
in the use of these names by Horace, as indeed there is
confessedly in their use by prose writers of much later date.
The name ‘ Scythae' is the most comprehensive, being used
apparently for all the tribes north of the Danube and Euxine.
At times it is brought into close relation with that of the Getae
(as in Od. 3. 24. 11), who again are closely connected by all
writers with the Daci. At other times it is associated with the
Geloni and the Tanais (‘Scythicus amnis,' Od. 3. 4. 36), and
denotes tribes far enough to the East to interfere in Parthian
politica The names are osten used merely as poetical expres-
sions of distance, the extreme North (as in Od. 2. 20), or
generally for the northern tribes, as the supposed representatives
of the manlier virtues (as in Od. 3. 24), or as the objects of the
vague fears of Roman statesmen (Od. 2. 11. 1).

The Daci are mentioned by Dio 51. 22 as offering their
services to Octavianus, and when their ternis were declined by
him joining Antony, to whom, however, they rendered little
assistance, as they were quarrelling amongst themselves (see

Od. 3. 6. 13).
