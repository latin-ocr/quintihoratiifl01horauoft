12 INTRODUCTION TO THE ODES, BOOKS I-lII.

appear of the position of these two Odes as well as of all the
others.

5. The hand of a conscious arranger must surely be seen
in the fact that Odes 1—9 of Book i contain, with three excep-
tions, one of which is made good in the 11th Ode, representa-
tives of all the metres employed in the Three Books. We may
compare with this the obviously metrical disposition of the
Epodes 1—10, 11-16‚ 17, and the regular alternation of Alcaics
and Sapphics through more than half of Book ii of the Odes.

6. Where definite contrasts are not required, we may see
from time to time in the selection the working of the opposite
principle of association, sometimes in a general similarity of
subject as between 2. 13, 14; 3. 9—12 z sometimes in some acci-
dental phrase or thought which seems to recall another poem
to the arranger, and guide his hand to it, as in 1. 17, where
Cyrus' tipsy brawls seem to suggest the Ode which follows on
the moderate use of wine3 1. 34, where the mention of Fortune,
even though in a different sense or point of view, is a link to
the following Ode to Fortuna Antias3 3. 17, where the invita-
tion to keep holiday, with which the Ode ends, suggests thev
special holiday picture of the Faunalia in 3. 18.
