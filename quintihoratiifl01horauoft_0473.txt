ODE XII.

‘W'inter is past, and Spring reigns again. The ice is gone, the
swallow builds, shepherds sing their songs in the open air. Come,
then, Virgilius, and inaugurate the thirsty season with a cask of the
best wine Ι can get you. But you shall not come empty handed3 you
bring the ointment if I find the wine. Above all, come with a mind
void of care, and prepared sor free enjoyment.⁷

The chief interest of the Ode centres in the question to whom it was
addressed. Is it a playful letter actually sent by Horace on' some
occasion to the great poet, and published six years after his death, not
so much for its intrinsic merits as for its reminiscences of their friend-
ship? On this theory gand it is held by Dills. and was held by Bantley)‚
we may expect there to be allusions in it which are now unintelligible,
though they would probably be well understood by Maecenas and the
many survivors of the literary circle in which Virgil and Horace met.
