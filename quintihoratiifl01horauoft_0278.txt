Line 1. ne doleas, ‘to prevent your grieving, consider these facts!
lt is not a direct prohibition, but the negative purpose of the coming
recital. Cp. 2. 1. 37 and 4. 9. 1.

plus nimio, see on Od. 1. 18. 15. It seems to qualify ‘doleas' as
well as ‘ memor.'

2. immitis Glycerae, with a play on her name which makes it an
oxymoron; πικρὸν Γλυκέριονε see on Od. 1. 22. 24.

miserabiles, ‘ piteous,⁷ ‘ moving pity.' Virg. G. 4. 514, of the
nightingale, ‘miserabile carmen Integrat.’ ¹

3. decantes. From the notion of ‘singing out to the end‚' comes
that of persistence, and then of the tediousness of repetition, the same
tune always. in which sense the verb is used constantly in Cicero, as de
Or. 2. 18. 75 ‘nec mihi opus est Graeco aliquo doctore qui mihi per-
vulgata praecepta decantet] Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 64 ‘naenia ..Curiis et
decantata Camillis.'

cur . . praeniteat, this is the question which he is perpetually asking
in his piteous elegies. Cp. Epp. 1. S. 10 ‘irascar amicis Cur me funesto
properent arcere veterno? ‘ be angry, and ask what they mean by warn-
ing me,’ etc. So in prose, Cic. ad Att. 3. 9 ‘ quod me accusas, cur hunc
meum casum tam graviter feram, (lebes ignoscere.'

5 soll. Cp. the sixth Idyll of Moschus, Ἥρα Πὰν Ἀχῶς τᾶς γείτονος
ἤρατο δ’ Ἀχῶ σκιρτητᾶ Σατύρα), Σάτυρος δ’ ἐπεμαίνετο Λύδᾳ, κ.τ.λ.

5. tenui fronte. Mart. 4. 42. 9 ‘frons brevis? Cp. Epp. Ι. 7. 26
‘ reddes . . nigros angusta fronte capillos? It is a mark there of youth
as well as of good looks, and seems to suggest that this admiration for
a low forehead, or rather for hair low down on the forehead, was con—
nected with the horror which a Roman felt for baldness.

6. torret. The metaphor is Sappho's, ὅπταις ἄμμε Fr. 115.

Cyrus . . Pholoen, see App. 1. The name of ·Cyrus' appears in
Od. 1. 17. 25, that of ‘ Pholoe fugax' in Od. 2. 5. 17. In both cases
the type of character, if not the person indicated, is the same as in
this place. ‘ Pholoe ' is the name of a coy or coquettish girl in Tibull.
1. 8.

in asperam declinat. ‘ Asperam' is not a mere epithet, but pre-
‹lieative. Cyrus, instead os pursuing Lycoris, turns aside aster Pholoe,
but only to find her bristles set against him.

7. prius, etc. Virg. E. 8. 26 ‘ Mopso Nisa datur: qnid non speremus
amantes? Iungentur iam gryphes equis.' Wolves of Apulia are named

in Od. 1. 22.18.
