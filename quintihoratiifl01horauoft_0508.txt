the murderer of his children.

87, 88. No interpretation more satisfactory on the whole has been ’ἶ

offered of these hard lines, than that suggested by Lambinus, and
adopted among recent editors by Dius„ and in its main points by Munro.
This makes ‘ venena‚' in the sense of φαρμακεῖαι, ‘veneficia‚' the subject
of the sentence, and understands an affirmative ‘valent’ with the first
clause. ‘Sorceries may overset the mighty laws of right and wrong,
they cannot overset the law of natural retribution,’ i.e. you may disregard
divine laws and kill me, but I shall have my turn yet, ¹ Diris agam vos.'
The merits of this interpretation are that the particular expressions
‘ convertere fas nefasque' and ⁶ humanam vicem' will harmonise
naturally, the first with Virgil’s ⁴ sas versum atque nefas,’ G. 1. 505,
the second with Horace's own ‘vices superbae‚’ Od. 1. 28. 32. We may
notice the additional parallel os ib. v. 34 ‘Teque piacula nulla resolvent’
to ‘dira detestatio Nulla expiatur victima.’ Bentley quotes also Ov.
Trist. 3. 1. 167 ‘ Humanaeque memor sortis quae tollit eosdem Et
premit, incertas ipse verere vices.' That the construction of the sentence,
although it is perhaps harsh for Horace, is yet Latin, Lambinus shows
from Cic. ad Att. 10. 1 ‘istum qui filium Brundisium de pace misit, me
legatum iri non arbitror'=‘ that he, etc„ will be sent as envoy, not 1.'
Munro would amend this version of the lines by separating ‘ mag-num '¹
from ‘fas nefasque) and making itz‘id quod magnum est‚’ ‘ sorceries,
such is their power, can overset,⁷ etc. Of other interpretations, the best
seem to be those which explain ‘ humanam vicem' by Sallust's ‘pecorum
vicem obtruncabantur? Cicero's ‘ Sardanapali vicem mori‚' ad Att. 10. 8,
‘after the fashion of men‚’ ἀνθρώπων δίκην. It would still be a question
whether ⁶ venena ’ was the object of ‘ convertere ⁷ or the subject of
‘ valent.’ In the first case it = ‘ veneficae‚' as ⁶ scelus' is used sor a wicked
person; there is an obvious point in refusing them a more personal
appellation‚ when the statement is that they have no human hearts to
be moved. The line of thought then is, ‘ Conscience cannot move you.
my curses may at least punish you? If we take it in the second way it
will mean, ‘The mighty laws of right and wrong are not like human
things, that soreeries should have power to overset them. You may
kill me, but Ι shall be revenged on you yet.'

NeitherMsS. nor Scholia give any variations ofthe text, and none ofthe
conjectures are attractive. Bentley (who offers it very hesitatingly) pro—
poses ‘magica,’ ⁵ non verteres Haupt ⁵ maga non,' Keller ‘humana invicem.'

89. diris, ⁵ curse5‚' as in the passage of Tacitus quoted on v. 85.

dira detestatio, the solemn denunciation of a curse.

92. Furor seems to be used as a masculine form of Furia. For the

idea of the passage cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 385.
