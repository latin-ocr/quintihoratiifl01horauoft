‘Denique cur nunquam caelo iacit undique puro
Iuppiter in terras fulmen sonitusque profundit?’—6. 400.

The notable changes of fortune in his mind at the time are very
possibly the vicissitudes of Phraates and Tiridates on the Parthian*
throne (see Introd. to Odes i—iii, ξ 8), though the expressions in vv. 14
fou. are not particular enough to necessitate this interpretation. The
framework of the Ode bears some resemblance to that of 1.22; each
centering round a circumstance in the poet's persona] experience. This
in both cases stands in the middle of the Ode, introduced by the
emphatic ‘namque' (1. 22. 9): it is the ground of the statements that
precede and follow. What he has witnessed in this case, and the cause
to which alone he can trace it, justisy both the general recantation of
stanza 1, and the solution which he gives in stanza 4 of the difficulty in
the human world which seems to him analogous to the thunder, for
which no ‘ secondary cause' was to be found, in the material world.

Line 2. insanientis sapientiae, σοφίας ἀσόφουι the oxymoron is con-
tinued in ‘consultus erro': σοφία or ‘sapientia' is the special name
that Lueretius claims for the Epicurean system, ‘vitae rationem . . .
earn quae nunc appellatur sapientia‚' 5. 10; cp. 2. 7 ‘ doctrina sapien-
tum.’

3. consultus, as used commonly with ‘iuris‚' meant one whose
opinion was sought, and so an adept, a professor. Livy had led the
way in transferring it to other arts, ⁴ iuris atque eloquentiae consultus‚’
10. 22.

4. iterare cursus relictos, ‘to steer again in the course Ι had
deserted‚' i. e. to return to the ways of thought to which Ι was ac-
customed before 1 learnt Epicureanism. Bentley, disliking the ex-
pression ‘relinquere cursus’ (‘relinquere viam’ he thinks would be
right, but ‘intermittere cursum'), and attracted by the frequent use by
the later poets of ‘relegere ’ with ‘cursus‚' ‘viam,' etc. (cp. Virg. Aen.
3. 690 ‘relegens errata retrorsum Litora ')‚ wished to read, ex mera
coniectura, ‘relectos‚’ which would be predicative, ‘to retrace and travel
again‚’ etc.

5. Diespiter, a religious archaism‚ affected by Horace again in Od.
3. 2. 29 ε cp. Varr. L. L. 5. 66 ‘antiquius Iovis nomen: nam olim Diovis
et Diespiter dictus, id est dies pater.’ So A. Gell. 6. 12 ‘ Iovis Diespater
appellatus est, id est, diei et lucis pate1·‚' and Macr. Saturn. 2. 15. It
is connected by thern with the name ‘Lucetius,⁷ given to him in the
hymns of the Salii. It occurs probably in the formula of the Fetiales,
Liv. Ι. 24 (see Prof. Seeley's note). On the etymology see Corssen,
Aussprach. 1. 2 33: he refuses to allow the composition osa Latin word
by means of a genitive case, and therefore sees in Dies· a form of the
