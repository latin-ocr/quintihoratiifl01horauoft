meliusque, ‘ and for ages that grow ever better?
68. prorogat. This and the corresponding ‘curat‚’ ‘applicat,’ are

‘⁴ the readings of B and V, against the more common ‘ proroget‚' ⁵ cu1·et,’

‘ applicet.' It would almost seem that the Scholiasts read the subjunctive
Ξ in the first case, but the indicative in the other two; sor they explain
that ‘si‚' from v. 65, must be repeated before ‘curat’ and ‘applicat'

ἵ (making them parallel with ‘ videt'), and the apodosis ‘ remque . . aevum’
  understood again. ‘ Proroget ’ they interpret by ‘prorogabitff' Acr. and
·. ‘ melius seculum futurum tribuet ¹ (with a v. l. ‘ tribuat ³), Porph. Their
κ explanation clearly cannot stand ; and, though Keller edits in accordance
¹ with their presumed reading, it is hard to see how the change of mood

can be justified. The indicatives are accepted, among recent editors, by
Dillr„ Ritter and Munro. Bentley argues strongly for them, pointing
out that the time for urgent prayer and expostulation is past. The
chorus has now assumed the tone of confidence and promise (according

:⁹5 to the stages named in Epp. 2. Ι. 134 ‘ Poscit opem chorus, et praesentia

numina sentit’). The last stanza, ‘Haec lovem sentire‚' etc„ comes
naturally to sum up and crown their assertions of Apollo's and Diana’s

‘i goodwill ; it would be abrupt if the prayer continued to v. 72.

69. Aventinum. The chief temple on the Aventine was that of
Diana; see Burn, p. 204, cp. Liv. 1. 45.

Algidum3 see Od. 1. 21. 6.

70. quindecim virorum. The ‘xv viri saeris faciendis‚' or ‘sa-

‘ crorum,' were the ‘collegium' who had the custody of the Sibylline

books, and the duty of superintending any religious ceremonies pre-

ζ scribed in them. The college at first consisted only of two. It was
J raised to ten about the year 13.C. 367 (‘ decemviri: Liv. 6. 37, 42), and
'· subsequently to fifteen, probably by Sulla. Aeneas is made to promise
· the Cumaean Sibyl the institution of the priesthood in Virg. Aen. 6. 72
⁴. ‘ Hic ego namque tuas sortes arcanaque fata, Dicta meae genti, ponam,

lectosque sacrabo, Alma, viros²
71. puerorum, both boys and girls, quite in accordance with the old

ἶ· use of ‘ puer ’ for either sex. Priscian quotes from Naevius, ‘ Proserpina
· puer Cereris‚' from Livius, ‘Saturni puer regina!
