478 HOA’ATJJ EPODON LIBER.

tion we may perhaps quote (with Bentley) Epp. 1. 19. 45 ⁶ Ad haec ego
naribus uti Formido‚' though it is a stronger support to his own reading ¹
‘ad hoe,' The general meaning is well given by Porph. ‘ [Gallorum] ¹
ideo mentio facta est ut Romanos qui sub praepositis spadonibus aequo
animo militarent magis oneraret per comparationem Gallorum qui hoc ἶ
dedignati ad Caesarem se contulerunt.⁷ The sense is not altered, while ζ
the construction is made simple by Bentley's conjecture, ‘ad hoe,' or
Fea's ‘at hoe,' adopted by Orelli and Dillr.; but the MSS. give no en-
couragement to either. ‘Ad hunc' is the reading which has the best
MS. authority (but B omits most of the Epode, and there is no testi-
mony to the reading of V), and it was interpreted by Acron. The other
readings with respectable authority are ‘adhuc‚' which must be taken
with ‘sreniente5,' ‘up till this time neighing for the fight'; and ‘at huc,'
which was read hythe Comm. Cruq.. and interpreted by him ‘but to
our side ⁷ ; cp. Vell. 2. 84 ‘ Hinc ad Antonium nemo; illinc ad Caesarem
quotidie aliquid transfugiebat.' Neither seems to connect the lines with
those that precede as well as ‘ad hunc!

deserted to Octavius at the commencement of the battle of Actium, Plut. .

canentes Caesarem, shouting his name as a war cry. The Scholiasts ,
quote Virg. Aen. 7. 698 ⁶ Ibant aequati numero regemque canebant.‘ ¹
19, 20. These lines obviously describe some naval defection which is

matched with the desertion of the Galatiam cavalry. The meaning of ᾗ

‘ sinistrorsum citae' has not been fully explained. Bentley suggested
that ‘puppim ciere,’=‘to put the stern in motion‚' may have been a
Latin equivalent of πρύμναν κρούεσθαι, ‘to back water‚' and that ‘sini- ἵ
strorsum⁷ may have had some technical meaning as a completion of the
phrase ; or that Horace may be speaking as one who looks at the scene i
of war from the north, so that ‘to the left’ would mean ‘eastwardj
i. e. into the Ambracian Gulf.

21. io Triumphe. ‘Triumphus' is personified‚ as in Od. 4. 2. 49,

see note there. There is an emphasis on ‘ tn,’ ‘ It must be the Triumph- g

god himself that delays the starting of the procession, all else is ready.'

22. intactas, ‘never yoked‚' and so fit for sacrifice; ‘ intacta cervice i

iuvencas‚¹ Virg. G. 4. 540, ‘grege de intacto mactare iuvencos,' Aen.
6. 38.

 

25. Africanum, sc. ‘reportasti parem ducem.’ The ‘monument ἶ
which his valour built sor him on the ruins of Carthage' is a meta· ¹
phorical monument. Vell. Patere. may have had these lines in mind ³

when he wrote of Scipio Africanus Minor ⁴ eam urbem funditus sustulit l
fecitque suae virtutis monumentum quod suerat avi eius clementiae.’
The reading ‘ Africano,' sc. ‘bello,' found in some good MSS. seems to
