EPODE IV.

A violent attack on some freedman, who moved the wrath os Horace
and of the citizens by his display and arrogance. ‘A little while ago
flogged as a slave: now with a fine estate in Campania, a pony-carriage
on the Appian way, and a seat at spectacles among the “equites ”!
With what face do we fit out fleets against Sextus Pompeius and his run-

period between his first desertIOn of Sextus Pompeius and his return to
his service in 36. Yet during that time he was serving with the fleet
which he had carried over to Octavianus’ side; and, though he may
