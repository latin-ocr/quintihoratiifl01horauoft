NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XXXVI. 251

The absence of any definite qualification of ‘fratrum,’ such as ‘a sra-
tribus occisorum‚’ is due partly to the fact just noticed that the word is
not intended to convey the suu seeling3 it is only one approach among
several 3-—the thought of brothers is a shanieful thought to Romans,
because they would think also how brothers had been treated, as the
thought of scars was shameful, because they could not but remember
the quarrel in which they had been come by——partly to the fact that
‘ fratrum ' as a correlative terrn leads our thoughts to its correlative ; of
‘ brothers’ conduct,⁷ means of their conduct as brothers, and so towards
their brethren. Cp. the pregnant use of ⁴ cives' in Od. 1. 2. 21. Any
more definite expression of the horror of fratricidal war is purposely
avoided and sunk in the general question ‘quid nos refugimus ? ⁷ With
the string of questions that follow, cp. Od. 2. 1. 29-36.

39. diffingas. This is the reading of almost all the good MSS.
and apparently of Aer. and Porph. The Berne MS. has ‘defingas,'
which Bentley adopted, altering at the same time ‘ retusum‚’ the unani-
mous reading of the old MSS„ to ‘recoctum,’ ‘ melt and forge anew.'
The verb ‘diffingere’ is found in no other author, and in Horace only
here and in Od. 3. 29. 47 ‘neque Diffinget infectumque reddet) The
Scholiasts interpret it here ‘refabricare‚’ ⁴ reformare‚' there ‘immutare'
It seems to mean ‘to make differently‚' i.e. (in this case) ‘to a different
purpose.’ The swords have been blunted in civil war, they are to be
beaten straight and sharp again for a foreign enemy. For the image
cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 636 ‘ recoquunt patrios fornacibus enses.¹

40. MassagetaS, a tribe living to the east of the Caspian.

ODE XXXVI.

‘Thanks to the gods that have brought Numida safe horne again,
to the delight of many friends, and of none more than his old school-
fellow Lamia. The day must have a white stone to mark it. We will
revel, we will dance ι Bassus shall rival Damalis in his draughts of wine
to-day. Every eye will be on Damalis ; but Damalis will have no
embraces for any one but Numida?

Nothing is known of Numida. Aer. and Porph. call him ‘ Pomponius
Numida: the Comm. Cruq. ‘Plotius.' The latter is more likely to be
right, as Numida is a known cognomen of the Plautia or Plotia gens.
It is usually supposed that he was returning from the Cantabrian war,
from which Augustus returned in Rc. 25 (Od. 3. 14). Numida may of
course conceivably have returned earlier.

For Lamia, see on Od. 1. 26.

For the subject of the Ode ep. 2. 7 on the return of Pompeius.
