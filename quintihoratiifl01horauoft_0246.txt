2 1 0 HORA TII CARMJNA. ’

The form at least of the poem was suggested by an Ode of Alcaeus,
of which we have the first line, Athen. 10. 8 :—

μηδὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω.

Metre—Sccond A sclcpz'ad.

Line 1. sacra, ‘ god-given,' belonging to Bacchus. Horace begins by
granting to the full the virtues of wine.

severis, sor the mood, see on Od. 1. 11. 13 ‘ sero' is Virgil's word
sor planting trees, G. 2. 275, etc.

2. mite, a soft and kindly soil, opp. to Virgil's ‘ difficile‚' G. 2. 279;
‘ amarum,’ ib. 238.

moenia Catili, a further description of ‘ Tiburis solum ' ; for Catilus
sce on Od. 1. 7. 13, and cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 672. Horace seems to stand
alone in shortening the penult. of the usual ‘Catillus.’ Compare his
use of ‘ P01·sena‚' Epod. 16. 4.

3. siccis, the opp. of ‘uvidis,' Od. 4. 5. 39 ‘dicimus integro sicci
mane die, dicimus uvidi Cum Sol Oceano subest'; cp. Epp. 1. 19. 9.

dura, tertiary prerl. ‘ All that heaven ever sets before them, every
task and fortune, is hard?

deus, as in Od. 1. 3. 21 ; not Bacchus, but the power which rules
our lise.

4. aliter, ‘in any other way than this‚' the true way is implied by
‘ siccis ³ in the opposed clause.

5. erepat, like the Gr. παταγεῖν, κροτεῖν, of rattling or tiresome talk,
S. 2. 3. 32 ‘ si quid Stertinius veri crepat '; A. P. 247 ‘ immunda crepent
ignominiosaque dicta.' So that it can only be used with the next verse
by a zeugma.

6. decens, Od. 1. 4. 6.

7. at. so of recent Editors‚ Keller, Orelli, Ritter, and Dissr. Cruquius
reads ‘ at ' without mentioning any v. 1., which is perhaps evidence that
he found it in his Blandinian MSS. B. and all tenth-century MSS.
(except τ, which has ‘ aut ') have ⁴ ac‚' and Bentley follows them. But
the passages which he quotes, Epp. 1. 1. 13, 1. 19. 26, 2. 1. 208, do not
require an adversative as strongly as this transition from the use to the
abuse os wine.

modici, ‘ that loves moderation,' ‘verecundum B'acchum‚' Od. 1. 27.
3. It would properly be the epithet of the draught. ὃς δ’ ἂν ὑπερβάλλῃ
πόσιος μέτρον, Theogn. 47, or of the proportions of the mixture, see on
Od. 1. 20. 1.

transiliat, see on 1. 3. 24. ‘ lightly to overpass the bounty of Liber,'
δῶρα Διονύσου, is not to be content with what the god allows us, but to
take more ‘invito Teos v. 11.
