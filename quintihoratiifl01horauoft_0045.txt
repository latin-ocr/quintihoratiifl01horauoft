 

ODES, BOOKS J—JJI. 9

portant Berne MS„ ignores the division into Books, and to
some extent rearranges the Odes3 but we may notice (a) that
the Fourth Book (which certainly was separate), and even the
Epodes, are treated in the sanie way as the Odes of Books i-iii;
(b) that a purpose can be probably assigned sor the rearrange-
ment3 (c) that if we deduct the variation caused by this
purpose, the order in which the Odes are placed bears distinct
witness in favour of the common arrangement ¹. Diomedes,
the writer on metre (who is quoted by Priscian, and therefore
cannot be later than the fifth century), refers to the Odes by
their present numbering.

ᾧ 11. It has also a considerable amount ofinternal evidence,
in the testimony <distinct as far as it goes, even if it do not
prove much) of Book iv 3—in the general analogy of Horace's
other collections of poems ;—and in many indications of design
(or at least of a mind at work in the disposition), which on
the one hand are inconsistent with the theory of a haphazard
redivision ofa mass of poems whose original arrangement had
been lost, and which on the other, in several points, suit well
with known characteristics of Horace’s taste.

1. Few can doubt that the references in the First Ode of
Book iv to 1. 19 and 3. 26, imply that these Odes must have
stood in Horace's disposition pretty much where they do nOW,
as one of the earliest and the latest of his love Odes.

2. Some kind of conscious arrangement, subsequent to com-
position and not chronological, is obvious on the face of the
Epodes, the Satires, and the Epistles. If there is nothing else,
there is the manifest choice of an opening poem, not usually it
would seem, if ever, earliest in date of compositi0n2, an apology
for the style of writing as in Sat. ii, or a quasi-dedicatory
address to his patron as in the Epodes, Sat. i, and both Books
of Epistles. The analogy between Odes i-iii and Epp.i is closer
still, in the assignment of the first place and the last but one

2 Epod. 1, if it refers, as is most probable, to Actium, is one of the

i two latest in the collection. Epp. 1. 1 and Sat. 1. 1 are generally

 

placed among the last compositions in their respective Books.
