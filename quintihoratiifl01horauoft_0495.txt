No TES. EPODE ss. 459

Idyll into an Epode. Its point is rather the strength os the ‘ruling

,λ passion' (cp. the ‘ mercator’ of Od. 1. 1. 16, who in the storm ‘otium

 

 

et oppidi Laudat rura sui: mox reficit rates Quassas') than, as has
been suggested, the elaborate hypocrisy osa money-lender who makes
his panegyric on a rustic life an excuse sor pressing his debtors for
repayment, while he means all the while to put the money out to
interest again at the next settlement-day.

The diction of the Epode reminds us eonstantly of the Georgics.

Line 3. exercet, of continuous labour at anything, Virg. G. 1. 99
‘ Exercetque frequens tellurem.’

4. solutus omni fenore. He has nothing to do with usurers; his
land came to him from his father3 his bullocks were bred on his farm.

5, 6. He is not a soldier to have his sleep broken by the bugle, nor a
trader to sear storms at sea.

7, 8. Cp. Virg. G. 2. 502 ‘nec ferrea iura Insanumque forum vidit:
and ib. 504 ‘alii . . penetrant aulas et limina regum.⁷

9. ergo. ‘And so,’-as he is free from these preoccupations, he can
enjoy the simple tasks and pleasures of the country.

propagine, the technical name for the young vine-plant grown from
a layer, Virg. G. 2. 26 and 63.

9-13. aut . . aut: . . que. Compare vv. 15, 16, 17 ‘aut,’ ‘aut‚’ ‘vel.'
The first triplet of alternatives describes the pleasant tasks of prepa-
ration, the second those of gathering the fruits. In each case the last
of the three is marked by a change of the conjunction, cp. vv. 31, 33,
35 ⁵ aut,’ ‘ aut‚⁷ ‘ que,’ Od. 1. 12. 5. 6 ⁶ aut‚' ‘ aut,’ ‘ve.’ Several editors
have followed Fabricius in transposing vv. 11, 12 and 13, 14, on the
ground that the pasturing of cattle seems out of place between the more
cognate operations of transplanting vines and grafting fruit-trees. But
it is scarcely possible that the mistake should have vitiated every exist-
ing MS. Bentley points out that the two operations are, after all, very
distinct, and belong to different times of the year. The feeling of the
passage is the great choice of pleasant tasks which the countryman
enjoys, and the sense of this would perhaps be diminished rather than
increased by sorting them too nicely.

10. altas answers to ‘ adulta’; the plants are now (in three years,
Col. de Arb. 7) grown large enough to clamber a tree, which would
have been too tall for them before. Ritter points out that ‘altas’
appeals to the eye, as does ‘prospectat’ in the next couplet. His
labour is associated with pleasant sights and sounds. For the metaphor
of‘rnaritat’ cp. Od. 2. 15. 4, 4. 5. 30.

13. que. It is better to take ‘que' as disjunctive (see on Od. Ι. 3.
9 and 3. 11. 49), than with Bentley to alter it here and in v. 63 to ⁴ ve.’
