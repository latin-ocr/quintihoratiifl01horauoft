to ‘good bullocks and horses owe their good qualities to their sires.'
As Bentley observes, if this were right, the eagles and the doves ought

not breed eagles. not that eagles did not breed doves.

30. est, ‘ survive& is something real.

35, 36. When there is a collapse of public manners (so that good
education becomes impossible), good birth is no protection against the
taint.

35. utcunque =‘ simulac '; see on 1. 17. 10.

37. indecorant. The MSS. vary between this word and ‘dedecorant.‘
The Scholiasts support ⁴ in(lecorant,' which, as the rarer word, was the
least likely to be substituted. It is found in a fragment of Accius.

38. Metaurum flumen, as ‘ fiumen Rhenum,' A. P. 18. The battle
of the Metaurus (a river of Umbria) was fought in ΒΩ, 207, by the
consuls C. Claudius Nero and M. Livius Salinator (both ancestors of
Drusus, one through his father, the other through his mother, Livia),
against Hasdrubal, who was bringing reinforcements to his brother
Hannibal; Liv. 27. 45 foll.

39. pulcher dies; 4. 2. 46 ‘O sol pulcher!’ The daylight is at
once literal and metaphorical.

41. qui primus, the first day of brightness and victory since
Hannibal began his campaign in Italy. There might have been
victories before, as that of Nola gained by M. Claudius Marcellus in
Bc 215 ; but this was the first decisive victory, the turning point of the
war. Appian (p. 344, De Bell. Annib.) speaks of it as ἰσοστάσιον [τῇ
ἐπὶ Κάνναις ἀτυχίᾳ].

war‚' and it was derived from ‘ ador'=‘corn.' ‘Gloriam . . a farris
honore adoream appellabant‚' Plin. N. H. IS. 3. The original connec-
tion is more doubtful. Pliny explains it of the donative of corn given
to the soldiers after a victory, N. H. 2. 18. Festus, s. v.‚ refers it, like
such words as ‘ pecunia,' to an agricultural age: ‘ adoream laudem sive
gloriam dicebant quia gloriosum eum putabant esse qui farris eopia
abundaret? Servius on Virg. Aen. 10. 677, has a still wilder derivation

42. dirus; see on 2. 12. 2.

ut, ‘ ever since‚' as in Epod. 7. 19, Cic. Brut. 5 ‘ ut illos libros edidisti
nihil a te postea accepimus.'

43. ceu. This is the only place where this word is used by Horace.
The images are of the speed and victoriousness of Hannibal's progress:
⁶ like fire through a piae-forest, or the east wind sweeping the Sicilian sea.’

44. Siculas3 see on 2. 12. 2. Horace may be referring to his own
