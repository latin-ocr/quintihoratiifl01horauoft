ODE XIV.

lVritten on the return of Augustus, in Rc. 24, from his campaign in
Spain, the last few months of which he had spent in sickness at Tarraco.
The Ode is not in Horace’s best manner. It may be compared for its
subject with 4. 2 and 5.

‘ Caesar is coming back a conqueror, like Hercules, from his dangerous
expedition to Spain. Prepare a public “ supplicatio.'’ His wife Livia,
his sister Octavia, mothers who are recovering their sons-in-law or sons,
the sons themselves and their young wives, all have their parts to play.
Ι shall keep my private holiday too, for Ι feel the peace and security of
Caesar's mle. Unguents, boy, and a garland, and a cask of the oldest
wine, and go and eall Neaera. If you can't get admittance to her, come
away ; we shall enjoy ourselves without her, though Ι should not have
been so easy seventeen years ago?

With the end of the Ode compare that of 1. 36 and 2. 11. The point
of the last stanzas lies in the words ⁶ eximet curas,’ v. 14. *The reason
is given and then the feeling is exemplified.

Line 1. Herculis ritu, a savourite mythical prototype of Augustus;
cp. 3. 3. 9, 4. 5. 36, Virg. Aen. 6. 802 ‘ Nec vero Alcides tantum telluris
obivit.’ But here there is special reference to Hercules' journey to
Spain after the oxen of Geryones,

modo . . morte, ‘a moment ago our thoughts were all on the danger
of his expedition, now they are on the triumph of his return.⁷

plebs. No exact parallel is quoted for this use of ‘plebs' for the
whole Roman people with no tinge of the old contemptuous tone.
There are plenty of passages which show that a Roman could use
‘ populus’ and ‘ plebs' at this time without any feeling of the old dis-
tinction (cp. 2. 2. 18 ‘Dissidens plebi numero beatorum Eximit virtus,
populumque falsis Dedoeet uti Vocibus), but they rather lower ‘populus ’
