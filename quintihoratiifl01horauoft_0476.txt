possessor, the produce of whose farm and vineyard was disposed ofin
this way. Orelli quotes an inscription which makes mention of some
‘ horrea Galbana‚' which would probably be ‘the same as the ‘ Sulpicia‚'
since ‘ Galba’ was a cognomen of the gens Sulpicia3 and Porph. asserts
that the name ‘ Galbae horrea’ belonged in his time to a certain store
of wine and on, etc. The form ‘Sulpiciis’ is, as Orelli points out,
regular. Cp. ⁶ Corneliae, Iuliae, leges'; ‘Licinia atria,' Cic. pro

ODE XIII.

‘ The gods have heard my prayers, Lyce. Ι have my revenge. You ἶ
are turning into an old woman, yet would sain hide it, and drink and
play and love as ever. Love turns away from your wrinkles; nor will
purple ganzes and jewellery bring back your youth. VVhere is the
beauty that 1 remember, the charms which made you second only to
Cinara P—Cinara, who died in her prime, while you live on for ever, for
young men to moralize on and laugh at.'

The Ode is a sequel to 3. 10, in which he eomplained of Lyce’s high .

airs, and warned her not to try her lover's patience too long.

9. importamus, ‘rudely‚’ ‘ruthlessly‚’ very like ‘improbus' in its
uses.
