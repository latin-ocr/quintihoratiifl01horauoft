Ι 66 HORA Tll CARMINIJM

created. It is appropriated here and elsewhere by a Roman poet with
a feeling that it describes his art also. It is on a knowledge and
imitation of Greek models that Horace rests his own title to farne.
The lute which his muse strings is the ‘ lute of Lesbos.’

hederae. The ivy crown belongs to the poet (Virg. E. 7. 23, 8. 13)
as inspired by Bacchus3 cp. Juv. 7. 64 ‘ dominis Cirrhae Nisaeque,'
Hor. Epp. Ι. 19. 4.

30. Dis miscent superis, not merely like ‘ evehit ad deos ’ above—-
‘glorify me. make me as happy as the godS,’ but ‘ admit me to a happy
dreamland,’ to the Μουσῶν νάπαι, the ‘ pii luci ⁷ of Od. 3. 4. 5 f011.; cp.
3. ²5· 1 foll.

32-34. tibias . . barbiton. The two instruments are intended to
include all varieties of lyric poetry; see on Od. 3. 4. 1-4, and cp. 1. 12.
Ι, 2. They are divided here between Euterpe and Polyhymnia. In
the two passages referred to they are both attributed in one case to
Calliope, in the other to Clio. In 1. 24 and in 4. 3. Horace traces his
inspiration to Melpomene. He knows nothing of any division amongst
the Nine of the different branehes of poetry. For the plural ‘tibias‚'
cp. Od. 4. 15. 30, Epod. 9. 5, and see Dict. Ant. S. v. The reference is
to the double pipe—two pipes used at the same time—one of a higher
the other of a lower pitch. Cp. Herod. 1. 17, where the αὐλοὶ ἀνδρὴϊοι
καὶ γυναικήϊοι are generally interpreted in this way.

34. Lesboum barbiton. The Greek form of adj. and subst. seems
to point to the imitative character of the poetry which he aspires to
write3 see on Od. 1. 32. 3, and on 4. 6. 20. It is to be noticed that
Horace prefers in the Odes the Greek form Helenen, Cypron, etc„ in
the Satires and Epistles the Latin Helenam, etc.

35. vatibus. The Greek lyric poets—for on Horace‘s showing they
had as yet no Roman rival. Cp. Od. 4. 3. 13, and note the change of
tone. He there claims as his own, by gift of the public voice, the
place which here he looks for at the hands of a patron.

36. feriam sidera. 1 shall be raised to the skies with glory. A
common Greek trope. Sapph. Fr. 9 ψαύειν δὲ πόλον δοκεῖ μοι οὐρανῶ
δυσπάχεα. Soph. O. C. 381 πρὸς οὐρανὸν βιβῶν.

ODE II.

‘We have seen and felt enough of the wrath of the gods. Our
population is thinned by civil war, while the Parthians desy us in safety.
What god can save our falling empne, or atone for our guilt‘? Apollo?
Venus? our father Mars? nay rather Mercury, who is amongst us in
human shape‚ and submitting to be called Caesar's avenger--you‚¹
