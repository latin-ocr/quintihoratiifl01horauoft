284 HORA ΤΠ CARMINA.

19. restinguet, ‘ put ont the fire of the wine.'

21. devium, probably with Ritter, predicative after ‘ eliciet‚’ ⁶ entice
to our retreat.⁷

23. in comptum. Some good MSS. have ‘ incomptum.' The editors
who have retained this reading seem generally to have constructed· nodum '
after ‘maturet‚⁷ ‘make quickly her simple knot.’ Cp. 3. 14. 21 ‘ Dic et
argutae properet Neaerae Murrheum nodo cohibere crinem’ ; but, as
Bentley remarked‚ ⁶ cum lyra ⁷ is an odd accompaniment to that action.
He reads ‘comma' with some fair MS. authority to back him, ‘in-
comptam ' with one MS. of Torrentius, and ‘ nodo ’ ex mera coniectura.
Mr. Munro‚ though reading ‘incomptum‚’ puts a comma at ‘maturet,'
constructing, I suppose, ‘incomptum nodum' as a cognate accusative

with ‘ religata.'

ODE XII.

‘ No, Maecenas, my lyric style will not do sor the great feats of Roman
arms, any more than it would for the heroic myths. You will celebrate
Caesar-‘s glories far better in your prose history. Ι will content myself
with >inging the charnis of your Licymnia and your love for her.’

With the Ode generally compare 1. 6. Ι

The Scholiasts (on Sat. 1. 2. 64) gave the tradition that Licymnia (or,
as they write it, ‘ Licinnia,’ probably a corruption to suit her relation-
ship to the Licinia gens3 see Introd. to Od. 2. 10) is a name invented by
Horace to veil and yet to represent to the initiated that of Terentia,
Maecenas-³ wife. For the practice both in Horace and in other poets, see

). 1.
Allientley pointed out that the mention of the public dance in Diana's

honour, implies that the person imagined is not merely a ‘ libertina!

The third stanza seems clearly (though Orelli doubts it, taking ⁶ tu' v
generally sor ‘any one') to imply a hope or a wish that Maecenas
may write some memoirs of the reign of Augustus Servius (on Virg.
G. 2. 42) vouches for his having done so; but the only older authority
that ean be quoted is a doubtful expression of Pliny, N. H. 7. 46.

Line 1. noli& either imperative, ‘desire me not'; or, perhaps better,
with Orelli, potential, ‘ you would not desire the old wars of Rome to be
set to the lyre, any more than the fights ot the Centaurs or the Titans.’
The conclusion in either case is, ‘no more ask me to set Augustus'
exploits.'

longa ferae. The two adjectives answer to one another aster
Horace's manner; see on Ι. 3. 10. Numantia was taken, after its long
resistance‚ by Scipio Africanus Minor, in ac. 153. Numantia, Hanni-
