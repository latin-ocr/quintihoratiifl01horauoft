account for the variant ‘altricis‚’ which divides the authorities with it.

extraxi-limen Apuliae. This is the reading of the great number of
MSS„ and apparently was found by Aer. and Porph. It is usually inter-
preted of part of Mt. Vultur, just beyond the border line. Horace
dwells on the character of the neighbourhood as ‘ debateable land’ on
the frontier of the two provinces, Sat. 2. 1. 34 ‘Lucanus an Apulus
anceps,' etc. There is, however, some reason for suspecting that this
reading was an early corruption. The minuteness of the local descrip-
tion and its paradoxical form have no special point, and the instances
quoted from other poets of variation of the quantity in such names as
Italus, Italia; Priamus, Priamides; Sieanus, etc. are hardly parallel to
the inversion of the quantity of two syllables in the same word, in the
same part of two consecutive lines. It is doubtful, besides, whether the
Roman poets ever shortened the first syllable of Apulia. The only
instance alleged is the ‘ mare Apulicum ’ of 3. 24. 4, where the reading
is at least as doubtful as the present one. Meanwhile, of the oldest MSS.
(we have no testimony with respect to V) the Beme and the Paris A, in
its first reading, have ‘ limina Pullie‚' and the Scholiast on γ reads the
same, and explains it as the proper name of the nurse. Acr. and Porph.
seem to have read ‘Apuliae,' but, odcssy, to have interpreted it in the
same way: ‘ F abulosam nutricem appellavit quod hae sere alumnis suis
narrare fabulas solent. Extra limen fabulosae Apuliae meae nutricis.
Provinciae nornen posuit pro nutricis,' Aer. So also on v. 19, Aer.
‘extra casae limen.' ‘Pollia’ or ‘Pullia’ is a name that occurs in
several inscriptions. It is barely possible then that we have here the
name of Horace's nurse, although it cannot be thought likely that none
of his readers and imitators in antiquity should have preserved her
memory. It is possible, again, that the word which completed the
verse may have been lost early, the copyist’s eye being caught by the
conclusion of the preceding verse; and it may have been some adjective
such as ‘ sedulae' (Bentl.) agreeing with ‘nutricis’ It is possible, Ritter
thinks, that ‘Apuliae’ was a gloss to explain some other name of the
district, such as ⁵ Dauniae.r Mr. Yonge's recent altemative suggestions,
‘villulae' and ‘vilicae’ (=‘house-keeper’), both rest on their resem-
blance to the latter part of the MS. reading Apuliae: the first also on
its agreement with Acron's gloss ‘ casae.' Mr. Munro refuses ‘ villulae’
‚on the ground of the rarity of diminutives, and this would be a double
diminutive, in Augustan poetry.
