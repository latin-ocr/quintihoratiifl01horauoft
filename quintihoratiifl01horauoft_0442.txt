406 HORA TIJ CARMINA.

48. felix, ‘ in my delight.'

49 foll. The difficulties of this stanza are well known, and no soliu-
tion of them is thoroughly satisfactory. The reading of the text is that
o'f the great preponderance of good authorities. ‘Tuque’ is found in
some MSS. of secondary value, and adopted by Ritter; ‘procedit’ is
found in the Berne MS„ having been proposed, in ignorance of that fact,
by Heinsius, and supported by Bentley. To whom does the pronoun
refer? Only two answers worthy of consideration have been given.
(1) To Antonius. In favour of this is the fact that ‘te’ at the begin·
ning of the next stanza undoubtedly belongs to him, and it is unlike
Horace’s finished workmanship to put the same pronoun in an em-
phatic place in two consecutive stanzas, when the subjects to which it
refers are wholly different. Against it must be counted the necessity
which it involves of acceptfflg, on very slender authority, the reading
‘ tuque‚' and the difficulty of putting any satisfactory meaning on ‘ dum
procedis.’ N ewman thinks that Antonius would ride in Augustus'
chariot as a member of the imperial family, by marriage with Marcella.
Ritter, that he would take part in the procession as praetor (this would
oblige usto postpone the date of the Ode to ao. 13). Bentley seems
really to dispose in advance of both suggestions. Antonius' place in
the procession, if he had one, could hardly be important enough to
bear the weight of this stanza. ‘ Dum procedis,' with no qualification
or hint that the eries of triumph were not for him, could hardly be said
of any person but the triumphing general. (2) To ‘ Tm‘umplzus‚’ the
triumph personified. ‘Thy name will we pronounce as thy procession
passes by, Ho Triumph ἔ again and again, Ho Triumph' i This is the
interpretation of Acr. and Porph. (‘ ad ipsum triumphum conversus haec
dicit '), and of Orelli, save that he accepts ‘ procedit’ srom the Berne
MS„ and takes it of Caesar, ⁶ as he passes along.' The only serious ob-
jection to it is the separation before noticed of the ‘te’ of this stanza
from the ⁴ te ⁷ of the next. Bentley objects, also, that we are taking ‘io
Triumphe’ in two different senses3 in the first line as in the poet's
mouth, in the second ‘materialiten’ as the cry to be uttered by the
people. But this is hardly true. The construction in both cases is ‘te
dicemus, io Triumphe? ‘ Io Triumphe ⁷ is an invocation of the personi-
fied Triumph-god3 it is also the actual cry uttered. Bentley ought
equally to object to Virgil's ‘Evoe Bacche fremens, solum te virgine
dignum Vociferans‚’ Aen. 7. 389, where ‘Evoe BaCChe' is at once the
actual cry of Amata and the vocative case which explains the ‘te dig.
num ² (not ‘ tu dignus es ')‚ in which the poet, not Amata, is the direct
speaker. For · io Triumphe' was the cry raised as the procession passed
along (it was an old cry, and not originally limited to triumphant pro-
cessions, for it occurs in the Hymn of the Fratres Arvales), cp. inter alp.
