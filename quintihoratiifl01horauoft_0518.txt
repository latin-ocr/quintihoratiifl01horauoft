482 HORA Tll EPODON LIBER.

EPODE XIII.

‘ It is stormy weather ; the occasion, if we will take it while we may,

for the greater merrirnent within doors. Bring the old wine. Do not ³

let us talk of any troubles. They will come straight again. Let us 1

draw the conclusion the Centaur taught his great pupil to draw. “You ’

are mortal. You will not come back from Troy. Enjoy life while you
are ‘cheres' ’

Compare Od. 1. 9, and see Introd. to it. The poem is addressed to
a circle of friends who seem to have some common care. In v. 6 the
poet addresses the symposiarch. The advice of Chiron to Achilles is
not found either in form or substance in any extant Greek poem. Com-
pare the story of Teucer in Od. 1. 7, of Prometheus in 1. 16.

Line 1. contraxit, Dius. quotes Cic. N. D. 2. 40. 102 ‘Sol modo
accedens tum autem recedens quasi tristitia quadam contrahit terram,
tum vicissim laetificat ’ ; which looks as if the metaphor here were ⁶ has
made the heaven frown.’ Orelli takes it to mean ‘has narrowed,’ sc. ‘the
clouds have hidden a great part of it.'

siluae, see on Od. 1. 23. 4.

4. de die. This phrase seems to have meant ‘ from early in the day,’
cp. the opp. ‘de nocte,’ Epp. 1. 2. 32, and to have been used specially
of beginning in the day-time occupations, such as feasting, which
belonged to the evening and night3 ‘ partem solido demere de die,’ Od.
1. Ι. 20, ‘Vos convivia lauta sumptuose De die facitis‚⁷ Catull. 47. 5,
Liv. 23. 8 ‘ epulari de die.’ Here it is perhaps more general in meaning?
‘ere the (lay passes‚⁷ ‘ere evening comes‚’ the evening of life as well as
of the particular day.

virent, genua, perhaps frorn Theoe. 14. 70 ποιῆν τί δεῖ ἇς γόνυ χλωρόν;
‘vire1·e,' of youthful vigorm is colnmon; Od. Ι. 9. 17 ⁶ Donec ’virenti
canities abest Morosa? so ‘viridis senectus,’ Yirg. Aen. 6. 304} The
knees are the seat of strength, as in Homer's ’γούνατα λύειν.

senectus, the signs and temper of age, as Epp. 1. IS. 47 ‘inhumanae
senium depone Camenae.’
