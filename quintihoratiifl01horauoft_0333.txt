’ΝΟΜ-3. BOOK Η, ODE XVI. 297

also like the epithets ‘purum‚' ‘puri‚' it implies cleanliness. ‘Iamdudum
splendet focus et tibi munda supellex,’ Epp. 1. 5. 7.

15. leves somnos, ‘ untroublcd,‘ 3. 1. 21 soll.

cupido, masculine, as always in Horace where the gender is marked,
Od.3.16.39, 3. ²4- 51, Sat. 1. 1. 61, Epp.1.1.33.

17. fortes, like ‘audax omnia perpeti‚’ Od. 1. 3. 363 no trouble or
disappointment daunts us. ‘Brevi' answers to ‘multas Life is too
short for many aims; the metaphor of ‘iaculamur' is that of the Gr.
τοξεύειν, Soph. O. T. 1196, etc.

18, 19. Cp. Virg. G. 2. 512 ‘Exilioque domos et dulcia limina mutant
Atque alio quaerunt patriam sub sole iacentem.' where Virgil uses
‘ muto' with the accusative of that which is surrendered3 Horace uses
it of that which is taken, but suppressing the other object of exchange.
Compare the uses of ἀλλάττειν, as Soph. Ant. 944 οὐράνιον φῶς (⁴ to
quit ’), Eur. Hec. 483 Αϊδα θαλάμους t‘to enter').

19. patriae exsul, Greek genitive, as φυγὰς Ἄργεος, Τ11808. ²4- 127,
imitated by ovid, Met. 6. 189 ‘exsul erat mundi,’ 9. 409 ‘exsul men-
tisque domusque.' For the sentiment cp. Lucr. 3. 1060-1070, Hor. S.
2. 7. 113 foll„ Epp. 1. 1 1. 27 ‘ Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare
currunt,’ 1. 14. 15 ⁴ In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam.’

21—24. Cp. 3. 1. 371011, ‘timor et minae Scandunt eodem quo dominus,
neque Decedit aerata triremi et Post equitem sedet atra cura.' The
image of the ship grows naturally in both passages out of what precedes.
‘It is of no use running away to other lands (in 3. Ι, to your seaside
villa) ; care goes on board with you.' ⁶ Aeratas naves‚' ί Aerata triremi‚’
seem to hint that care might have been expected to stand in awe of
a rich rnan's well-appointed trireme (cp. Epp. 1. 1. 93 ⁸ conducto navigio
aeque Nauseat ac locuples quem ducit priva triremis ⁷). The same ad-
ditional idea is probably contained in the ⁴ turmas equitum‚’ into which
- the simpler ⁶ equitem ' of 3. 1. 40 is expanded in this Ode. Horace pro-
bably had in mind Lucretius' account (2. 46) of the bold front with
which ‘curae . . sequaces . . Nec metuunt sonitus armorum nec fera
tela, Audacterque inter reges rerumque potentes Versantur.¹ At the
end of the stanza both images have merged in the general idea of
the impossibility of flying from care which is fleeter than a stag or a
storm—wind.

21. vitiosa, ‘morbid' The adjective rather interferes with the per-
sonification‚ but it is Horace's manner, see on 1. 35. 21 ‘Spes et albo
rara Fides colit Velata panno.'

25. ‘When happy in the present let the heart shun all care for
what is beyond; when the cup is bitter, sweettn it with the smile of
patience.’

quod ultra est, ’τὰ πόρρω, ‘ the future.’
