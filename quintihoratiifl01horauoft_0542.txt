506 INDEX OF METRES.

before the dactyl, φαίνεταί μοι κῆνος ἰ’σος θεοῖσιν, ‘Ille mi par
esse deo videtur.’ The lengthening of the short syllable in 2.
6. 14, ‘Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto‚' is perhaps a trace of
the feeling that, as the first syllable of the dactyl, it had the
metrical accent upon it.

The caesura falls commonly, in the first three Books, after
the fifth syllable, ⁴ Iam satis terris,' though it is found, from time
to time, after the sixth, ‘ Quem virum aut heroa.' In the Carm.
Sec. and the Fourth Book, Horace returns in this point to the
use of Catullus and the Greek, and employs the second caesura
frequently. In either the three Sapphic Odes of Book Four
together, or in the Carni. Sec. alone, there are twice as many
instances of it as in the twenty-one Odes of the earlier Books.

There is no synaphea, but hypermetric syllables are occa-
sionally elided at the end of all the first three verses of the
stanza (2. 2. 18, 2. 16. 34, 4. 2. 22, 23, C. S. 47). By Sappho the
Adonic was treated as if it scanned continuously with the verse
before, and this use is preserved in Horace to some extent,
a word being at times divided between them (1. 2. 19, 1. 25. 11,
2. 16. 7). On the other hand, we find a hiatus at times, as in
1. 2. 47 ‘Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum Ocior aura.'

ᾧ 4. Ῐαηῑόίε metres.
Of these two occur in Horace :—

(1) The common Senarius or Iambic Trimeter (for the

name see Ars Poet. 252) in Epod. 17.

(2) Couplets of the Senarius and an Iambic Dimeter in ’

Epod. 1—10.

Horace does not observe the law of the Greek Tragic Sena-
rius in respect of a short syllable before a final cretic ; see eg.
Epod. 1. 27 and 29.

Three instances occur of an apparent anapaest in the fifth κ ’

place: Epod. 2. 35 ‘laque0,’ 5. 79 ‘inferius,' 11. 23 ‘mulier-
culam⁷; but Meineke rightly explained them as instances of
synizesis, or using e and ι’ as semivowels, after the analogy of
‘aurea' in Virg. Aen. Ι. 698, and of ‘consilium’ and ‘prin-
cipium ' in Od. 3. 4. 41 and 3. 6. 6.
