486 HORA T II EPODON LIBER.

ire? The genuineness of the quotation is confirmed by Servius, who,

on Virg. Aen. 5. 755, refers to Sallust as having spoken of the μακάρων j

νῆσοι. Plutarch tells the same story in the life of Sertorius, ch. 9. It ἱ,

is very possible that Horace may have heard it, and that it may have
suggested the conclusion of the Epode.

Compare the description of the Happy Islands both in thought and ⁸

expression with Virgil’s Golden Age in Ecl. 4.

Line 1. altera aetas3 the first would be the generation of Sylla and

Marius. ¹
teritur, ‘ is being wasted‚' Virg. Aen. 4. 271.
2. Epod. 7. 10.

3—8. For the absence of chronological order in the list of national .

dangers cp. Od. 1. 12. 33-44‚ 2. 12. 1-4. The arrangement, such as it
is, is geographical. ‘ No enemy however near home or far away.’

3. Marsi. The reference is to the Marsic or Social war, Bc. 91-88, ³

cp. Od. 3. 14. 18.

5. Capuae. With special reference, no doubt‚t0 the revolt of Capua ,
in the second Punic war; but the popular jealousy of Capua as a =
possible rival of Rome lasted so late that Cicero plays upon itin his ,

two speeches. de Leg. Agr. contr. Rullum.

Spart-aeus, cp. Od. 3. 14. 19; the Thracian freebooter who, having ε

been taken' and sold as a gladiator, escaped, and was for two years
(Bc. 73—71) the terror of Rome as the leader of the Servile war.

6. novis rebus infidelis, ‘ the faithless ally of revolution ¹ (‘rebus '
is the dativeN, in allusion to the part which the ambassadors of the
Allobroges played in encouraging and betraying the Catilinarian con-

spiracy, Sall. Cat. 41, Cic. in. Cat. 3. The Allobroges stand as the θ

representatives of the Gauls generally, and the point of the epithet
seems to lie in their fasthlessness, of which it called to mind a signal
recent instance. Their territory lay between the Rhone and the Isere.

7. caerulea, ‘blue-eyed‚’ Juv. 13. 164 ‘Caerula quis stupuit Ger—
mani lumina, flavam Caesarie-m? The reference is to the incursions of
the Cimbri and Teutones, which were finally checked by Marius and
Catulus in the battles of Aquae Sextiae (Bc. 102) and Raudii Campi
(Bc. 101).

8. parentibus abominatus. Orelli and Diur. take ‘parentibus ' as
⁶ our forefathers,’ but the parallel, Od. 1. r. 24 ‘bella matribus detestata,'
seems conclusive in favour of the simplet meaning. Compare the
common epithet, ‘dirus Hannibal.'

9. devoti sanguinis, the descriptive genitive, Madv. ξ 287. The
