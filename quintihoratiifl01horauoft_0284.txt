is ‹loubtless its true sense, ‘ as her slave‚' ‘ quasi sit Necessitas comes et
ministra Fortunae.’ Keller reads ‘saeva‚' thinking that ‘serva' owed
its origin to some such gloss as this of Acron’s, which had really been Ἴ
meant to interpret ‘anteit' ‘ Anteit ’ does not seem to require ‘ serva.'
As Bentley pointed out, it is not a technical term which might be
needed to complete a picture. The ‘anteambulones' or ‘antepedes'
were not ordinarily slaves (Becker’s Gallus, Exc. B), but poor clients or
friends who ran before their patron to clear the way for him. ‘Servi'
or ‘ancillae’ would rather follow behind, as ‘pedisequi' or ‘pedisequae.'
Doom is made to wall< before Fortune, probably rather because Hope
and Loyalty go by her side or after her than for the sake of any definite
picture from Roman life. On the other hand, ‘Necessitas’ seems to
want an epithet as in the corresponding passage (q. v.)‚ Od. 3. 24. 6 ‘ Si
figit adamantinos Summis verticibus dira Necessitas Clavos.' The nails,
etc. belong to Necessitas: they are not carried by her for Fortuna.
We do not wish, even isit were possible, to make too perfect an image
of the procession. The details of one part of it are not really congruous
with those os another. ⁸ Doom goes before the steps of Fortune;
Doom, whose handiwork man cannot undo.' We want every word that
we can spare to heighten the picture of Doom. Her relation to Fortune
is lightly passed over.

18. clavos trabales, nails such as are used to fix bearns. In a like
symbolic sense, Cic. Verr. 2. 5. 21 ‘Ut hoc beneficium quemadmodum
dicitur clavo trabali figeret‚’ i.e. ‘ut ratum ac firmum faceret.'

cuneos, ‘ wedge-shaped nails.' Cie„ who translates from Aeseh„
speaks of Prometheus as fastened to the rock by means of ‘ cunei‚’ Tusc.

19. severus, ‘ inexorable ⁷ : the quality which is the very object to be
symbolized is attributed to the symbol, see notes on Od. 2. 2. 1, 4. 2.
7, 8. The ‘uncus' is an iron cramp which, fastened by molten lead,
was used to join blocks of stone, such as the joints ofa column, Vitr.
2. S. The implements which Necessitas carries are all emblems of the
fixity of her sentence. The point is not that they are implements of
building, but that they are the implements which make a building
indissoluble. Others besides her may be supposed to be planning and
building, but what she builds none shall throw down or break in pieeeS.
The metaphorical use both of nails and of molten lead is old; Pind.

267 καὶ γὰρ εἶ πέριξ σ’ ἔχει τηκτὸς μόλυβδος. On a cup found at Perugia
is a representation of Atropos holding a nail against a wall with her
left hand and lifting a hammer with the right, Dict. Ant. s. v. ‘ clavus.’
