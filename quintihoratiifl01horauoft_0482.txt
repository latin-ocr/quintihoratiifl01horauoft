446 ΗΘΚΛ Tll CARMJNA.

35. supplex; cp. ‘genibus minor,' Epp. 1. 12. 26.

36. vacuam, the palace lest empty by the death of Antony and
Cleopatra; see 1. 37.

39. ‘And has added to your past campaigns the fresh glory of this
much-desired laureL’ ‘ Laudem et decus,' the second substantive is the
vehicle for the qualifications ‘ optatum.' ‘arrogavit,' which thus obtain
more force than if they had to share the emphasis in a clause with the
main substantive itself. ‘Glory, even the one glory that remained to
be added to thy triumphs.’ That ‘imperiis' refers to past campaigns,
not to the commands of Augustus, which have been successfully carried
out in this one, is evident from what follows. The succeeding stanzas
are expansions of ‘peracta imperia.’

41. cannabem see 1ntrod. to Books i—iii, 1. ξ 6.

42· Medus, the Parthian53 4. 15. 6, Epp. 1. 18. They restored the
standard in ne. 20.

Indus . . scytham Carm. Sec. 55, 56, Suet. Oct. 21. Augustus is
said to have received embassies and overtures of friendship from India
and Scythia.

profugus; 1. 359, 3. 24. 9.

43. praesens; 3. 5. 2. Here, probably, the immediate contrast is
between distant nations‚ who have to send from the ends of the earth to
solicit Augustus' favour, and Italy and Rome to which he is an abiding
presence of protection.

44. dominae; 4. 3. 13 ‘Romae principis urbium.'

45. fontium qui celat origines. This applies of course primarily
to the Nile, the sources os whose waters were a world-old problem
(Herod. 2. 2S); but the position of the copulatives seems to show that
the Danube is included. Herodotus (2. 33) imagines it to be the exact
counterpart of the Nile, and the correspondence was extended by others
to this special point. Sen. Quaest. Nat. 4. 1 ⁶ Danubium (Nilo) similem
natura philosophi tradiderunt, quod et fontis ignoti et aestate quam
hieme maior sit,’ Auson. Epigr. 4. 1 ‘Danubius penitis caput occultatus
in oris.' The rivers stand for their respective countries—Egypt, Dacia,
Armenia (Epp. 1. 12. 26). The force of the epithet ‘qui celat,' etc., is
10 point the distance to which Augustus' rule extends. It spreads up
rivers whose source no traveller has explored.

47. beluosus3 3. 27. 26 ‘scatentem Beluis pontum.’ The adjective
is found in no other good author. It seems to owe its formation to the
Greek μεγακήτης, βαθυκὴτης, etc. 3 cp. 1. 3. 18. There is possibly real
reference in this case to the whales of the northern seas. Britain was
not in the reign of Augustus in any sense reduced, but the princes of
different tribes had sent-embas'sies to him with presents and professions

of sriendship; Strabo, 4. 5. 3.
