NOTES. BOOKIII, ODE III. 319

that the poet's purpose is to condemn Trojan manners, Asiatic perfidy
and luxury, and that the rebuilding of Troy is an allegory‚ suggested
, perhaps by the rumour before mentioned of Julius Caesar's design. Cp.
Carm. Sec. 37 solt, etc.

The Ode is more in Pindar's style than any that precedes it. The
mythological portion of it occupies a larger space, is handled with more
sreedom, and is lest more completely to tell its own tale. Cp. 3. 11
and 3. 27.

Several MSS.. including V and A (B omits Odes 2-6), wrote this Ode
continuously with the Second; aud Porphyrion, noticing the question,
decides that they ⁴ manifeste cohaerent.' The authority of the MSS. on
the point (see Introd. to 1. 7) is weakened by the fact that the same ones
join 2. 15 and 16, evidently wrongly. Ode 2 has no unity which would
be injured by a closer connection with 3, and the topic of its last two
stanzas is not alien to the praise of justice and constancy. Porphyrion
is inclined to press too hard the connection between the six Odes; see

note to Od. 3. 4.1.

Line 3. voltus, as τὸ σὸν δείσας πρόσωπον, Soph. O. T. 448.

4. mente is the ablative of the part affected.

solida, ‘rock-like’; the metaphor is interpreted in Sen. de Consol.
Sap. 3 ‘Quemadmodum proiecti in altum scopuli mare frangunt ita
sapientis animus solidus est.' Simonides' τετράγωνος ἀνεὺ ψόγου, which
the commentators, including Orelli, quote, is not in point, for it refers
to the perfe'ction, not as this does to the firmness, of the wise man’s

mind.

5. dux, as ‘arbiter Hadriae‚’ 1. 3. 15.

turbidus, the captain is as disorderly as his crew.

7. orbis seems to mean ‘the round sky’; cp. 1. 16. 11 ‘nec saevus
ignis, nec tremendo Iuppiter ipse ruens tumultu,' Theogn. 869 ἔν μοι
ἔπειτα πέσοι μέγας οὐρανὸς εὐρὺς ὕπερθεν, Lucan. 2. 290, in the same
connection as this, ‘Sidera quis mundumque velit spectare cadentem
Expers ipse metus? quis quum ruit arduus aether . .Complosas tenuisse
manus?’

9-15. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 5-12 ‘Romulus et Liber pater et cum Castore
Pollux‚’ etc.. where Augustus is ranked with the same mythological
benefactors of mankind, but distinguished from them as having received
his apotheosis in his lifetime, while theirs was delayed by envy till after
their death. See also the comments passed (Tac. Ann. 4. 38) on Tiberius'
refusal to accept divine honours, ‘ Optimos quippe mortalium altissima
cupere; sic Herculem et Liberum apud Graecos, Quirinum apud nos

deum numero additos.’
9, arte, cp. ‘veteres artes,’ 4. 15. 12.
