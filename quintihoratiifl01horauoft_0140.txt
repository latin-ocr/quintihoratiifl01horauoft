104 INTRODUCTION TO THE

the occasion of Ode 1 1, and he is spoken of in terms of the old
affection3 but (1) we have no hint now of his being still in-
terested in politics, a change which tallies with the date assigned
by Dio (54. 19) to his loss of Augustus' favour and retirement
from public affairs in ΒΕ. 16 ; and (2) he is no longer the patron
to whose praise Horace looks as his highest reward. The three
Books of Odes have been published for some time, and the
verdict anticipated in 3. 30 has been accorded to them. Their
author is now the intimate of Augustus. He has been chosen
to compose the hymn for the Secular Games, and the public
voice ratified the emperor's selection. He is now writing‚ not
in the hope of winning a name for himself, but at Augustus'
desire, and because his praise will confessedly give lustre to
the emperor and his family.

It may be added, that the versification of the leading Odes
gives some witness to the lateness of their composition; the
Sapphic Odes in the frequency of the hexemimeral caesura,
which assimilates them to the Carm. Sec.; and the Alcaic in
the greater strictness with respect to the structure of v. 3 of the
stanza, and the complete exclusion of the short anacrusis in
vv. 1, 2, 3 (see Index of Metres).

It has been said before (p. 8) that Book iv exhibits more
proofs of artistic purpose in its arrangement than any other
collection of Horace's poems.

1. The most obvious instance, perhaps, is the disposition of · ,

the four Odes for the sake of which we may say the Book was
composed. They stand in two pairs (evidently not on any
chronological ground, for Ode 6 must be at least two years
earlier than any of thern) at the beginning of the Book (after
a prelude‚ which will be noticed presently) and at its end.
Each pair is divided between Augustus and one of the young
princes 3 so that any praises of the latter may seem to lead up
to and merge themselves in the glory of the former.

2. Scarcely less noticeable is the sequence of thought ex-
pressed or suggested in the three Odes which precede the
main theme. It has been remarked before (p. 9) that a some-
what similar relation may be traced in the first Ode of Book i ;
