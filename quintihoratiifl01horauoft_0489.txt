26. seme1; see on Od. 4. 3. 1.

27. pez-actim Od. 4. 14. 39.

29. fertilis frugum ; supra v. 19.

30. In reference to the ceremonies of the Ambarvalia, the festival

when the sickle was to be put to the corn ; see the description in Tibull.
2. 1, and cp. v. 3 ‘Spinis tempora cinge, Ceres! The Fratres Arvales
wore as a badge os office a ehaplet of wheat—ear53 ‘Spicea corona‚’
Plin. N. H. 18. 2.

32. Iovis, the god os the air3 Od. 1. 1. 25, ete.

33. condito telo ; Od. 2. 10. 19 ‘ neque semper arcum Tendit
Apollo.’ His arrows carried pestilence (Hom. Il. 1. 50 foll.)‚ so that
it is a condition of the fulfilment of the prayer of the last stanza. Mac-
leane remarks that the statues of Apollo Actiacus, which Augustus had
dedicated in his new temple on the Palafine, represented him in a
bard's dress and with a lyre, although on the promontory of Actium he
stood with a drawn bow. Cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 274, 8. 704 with Propert.
3. 23. 5, 6 and 15.16.

35. bicornis recalls her form as she is represented on medals, ete„
with the crescent on her forehead.

37 foll. In the first clause the idea is put simply, ‘Rome is your
handiwork¹; in the following clauses the same idea is suggested by the
emphatic words ‘Iliae' (Rome is a colony of Troy, and Apollo and
Artemis were guardians of Troy), ‘iussas ‘ sospite' (under divine safe—
guard), ‘ castus ⁷ (and so under the protection of the goddess of chastity).
Compare with the whole Od. 3. 3. 18 foll. with Introd. There is the
same eontrast between the ⁴ remnant’ preserved and the guilty city
destroyed: ⁴ Castus . . patriae superstes ’; the rest were ‘incesti’ (see 3.
3. 19 and 23). That there is a moral meaning here at least is clear
from the petition in which this appeal ends, ‘ Di probos morea9 etc„ the
character of Aeneas, not of Paris, and therefore the old age of Aeneas,
not of Priam.

44. plura relictis, ‘ more than all they left behind,‘ Rome instead of
Troy.

45, 46. docili, placidae. Both are predicative, but some variety is
obtained by their different relation to the accusative. The ⁶ docility ’ is
a condition of, or at least a prior gift to, the gift of ‘ honest lives ⁹ ; the
‘calm ' of temper follows the gift of external quiet.

47. Romulae; see Od. 4. 5. 1, and on 1. 15. 10. For the elision of
“que ’ at the end of the line cp. Od. 4. 2. 22, 23.

2. 124, Virg. Aen. 3. 4603 here, as in Sat. 2. 6. 8 ‘si veneror stultus
