NOTES. BOOKIV, ODE XV. 449

potor! The peoples meant may be either the Vindelici (4. 4. 18),
against whom Tiberius had won some victories, or the Daci (3. 6. 13,
Virg. G. 2. 497 ‘coniurato descendens Dacus ab Istro ')‚ who used to
be spoken of as dangerous in the early years of Augustus' reign.

22. edjeta Iulia. We must no more look for a technical meaning in
‘edicta‚’ than for exact historical facts to correspond with the general
statement. ‘ Edictum: though limited in use very much to the praetor’s
edicts‚ was a general term for any command issued by a magistrate.
The form of the phrase is intended to recall ‘leges Iuliae: the name
which covered the domestic legislation of Augustus as well as Julius.
The substance, so far as it had any which can be reahsed, would be
terms of peace, which Augustus has imposed on the various nations.

Getae3 see Introd. to Books i-iii, 1. ξ) 7.

23. Sel-<333 see on 1.12. 56.

infidi· Persae; Epp. 2. 1. 112 ‘Parthis mendacior!

24. A paraphrase for ‘Scythae’3 3. 29. 28.

25. nosque, ‘ and for us, we,' etc.

28. apprecati‚ only found in this place, and twice in Apuleius.

29. virtute functos, ‘who have lived their lives like men.' Horace
adapts the use of ‘ functus vita,’ ⁵ functus laboribus: ‘ whose labours are
over‚' 2. 18. 38, of the dead, substituting a character of the life and its
employments. Compare the prose expression in Cic. Tusc. 1. 45 ‘nemo
parum diu vixit qui virtutis perfecto functus est munere.'

more patrum, with ‘ canemus! Cicero twice (Tusc. 1. 2 and 4. 2)
quotes the authority of Cato's ‘ Origines’ for such a custom in earlier
generations : ‘ solitos in epulis canere convivas ad tibicinem de clarorum
virorum virtutibus.’

30. Lydis. Possibly only a poetical epithet helping ‘ more patrum‚'
by suggesting the antiquity of the instrument ; but in Epod. 9. 6 Horace
seems to lay emphasis on a distinction of the Dorian and Phrygian
modes, so that here he may designedly speak of the Lydian as the one
most suitable for this occasion. In that case it may harmonise with the
‘iocosi munera Liberi,’ being elassed by Plato (Rep. 3, p. 398) as one
of the μαλακαὶ καὶ ξυμποτικαῖ ἁρμονίαι.

remixt03 A. P. 151. The word is only found besides in two passages

ζ of Seneca.

32. progem'em Veneris; cp. C. S. 50 ‘ Clarus Anchisae Venerisque
sanguiS.’ So that their topics correspond to those of Od. 1. 12 (cp. Ι.
12. 13 with v. 28 of this Ode): the gods, the heroes of Roman story,
the Julian house, and Augustus its crowning glory.
