HORATII CARMEN 5133CULARE.

‘Phoebus and Diana, grant the prayers duly offered at this sacred
season (v. 1-8). '

O sun, ever changing yet ever the same, let Rome‘s pre—eminence be ι

as changeless (v. 9—12).

Diana, birth goddess, guard our mothers (v. 13—16).

Bless our new marriage laws to the increase of our people, that each
“seculum'’ may find us still celebrating this festival (v. 17-24).

O Desfinies, fulfil the happy mactes, and add future to past blessings; ,
fertility of earth and cattle; seasonable rain and pure air (v. 25-32). ¹

Apollo, hear us boys (v. 33, 34).

Diana, hear us girls (v. 35, 36).

If Rome is your creation, the remnant saved srom Troy sor Aeneas' ἒ
piety, give our youth Aeneas’ manners, and our old men his happy old ⁴
age. Give Rome all blessings (v. 37—48). ⁴

And grant the prayers now offered by Aeneas' great son. He has ¹
subdued the Mede, the Scyth, the Indian. He has restored peace and

virtue and plenty (v. 49—60).

Phoebus, pleased with his Palatine temple, promises another lustrum j

and increasing years of prosperity (v. 61-68). γ
Diana listens to the “quindecimviri,’' and the chorus of boys and ἱ
girls ; and all the gods approve andjoin in their blessing ’ (v. 69-76).

That there was some division of parts between the male and female J
singers seems probable on the face of the Ode, and the Sibylline verses ζ
(ν. 20) seem to speak definitely of such a division. It is not so easy ἑ

to see what the diw‘sion was». Steiner arranges the Ode as follows :—
Str. 1. 2, proodus, boys and girls together.

str. 3 4 str. 9 mcsodus str.1o 1 1
5 1 boys 6 ξ girls vv. 1, 2 boys 12 }boys 13 }girls
7 i 8 3, 4 girls 14 15

 

 

str. 16-19‚ epodus, boys and girls together.

Ritter amends this arrangement by assigning 10—12 to the boys, '

13-15 to the girls3 16 to the boys, answered to by 17 from the girls.
Then in 18 the girls begin, and would be answered in a similar way

by the boys, but this is changed into a final strophe by the united 3
Lh'cl'lhere are obvious difficulties in the way of both.
