imperi porrecta maiestas ad ortus solis et Hesperium cubile' seems to
combine both shades of meaning.

27. minus audientem, ⁴ turning a deas ear to their litanies.’ Vesta
is represented as offended at the murder of the Pontifex Maximus,
whose office was specially connected with her service and temple, see
above, v. 16. Ordinarily she would be the protectress of Rome.

29. scelus, ἄγος, guilt which involves ceremonial pollution. Cp.
Virg. E. 4. 13 ‘ sceleris vestigia nostri’3 Hor. Epod. 7. 1 ‘Quo, quo,
scelesti ruitis Ῥ The ‘ see1us‚¹ which in those places is the guilt of civil
bloodshed generally, is here summed up in the murder of Caesar.

31. Hom. 11. 5. 186 νεφέλῃ εἰλυμένος ὤμους, veiling his brightness
that mortals might look upon him.

32. augur. Apollo (μάντις, Διὸς ffpfflpv'yrrysl—Romanized as the god
of augury. Virg. Aen. ⁴· 376‚——1nay tell them how the pollution is to
be removed.

33. Erycina, ‘Venus,’ from her temple on Mount Eryx in Sicily,
Virg. Aen. 5. 759. The people of Segesta applied to Tiberius to restore
this temple on the ground of its mythical connection with the founder
of the Julian gens, and he ‘suscepit curam libens ut consanguineus,’
Tac. Ann. 4. 43.

ridens, φιλομμειδὴς.

35. genus et nepotes‚=‘genus nepotum,’ Od. 3. 17. 3. The pur-
pose of the hendiadys is to give full emphasis to ‘neglectum’ and to
‘auctor ’ by allowing each a clause to itself.

36. auctor. Mars, the father of Romulus and Remus3 Virg. Aen. 4.
365 ¹ generis nec Dardanus auctor?

37. ludo, war is the sport of Mars (see on Od. 1. 28. 17) as the turns

of lovers, of Venus and Cupid, Ι. 33. 10, 3. 27. 67.

39. Mauri. This is the reading of all the MSS. and of Acr. and
Porph. Tan. Faber conjectured ⁵ Marsi? and Bentley argues at length
sor it on the ground that the ‘ Mauri’ were ⁴ nec fortes, nec pedites, nec
cominus pugnantes.’ To the first point Ritter well answers that it is
ferocity. not courage, which is in question. For the others he shows
from Sall. Jug. 59. that the Numidae at least had learnt at this time to
rningle foot soldiers amongst their cavalry. For the Roman practice
in this respect see Liv. 26. 4, Caes. B. G. 1. 48, 7. 65. This is simpler
than Orelli's explanation of ⁵ peditis,' ‘ dismounted.’

41—43. ‘Or if thou be sweet Maia's winged child wearing on earth
the disguise of human youth?

4¹· iuvenem, Virg. E. 1. 43 ‘ Hic illurn vidi iuvenem’; G. Ι. 500
‘ H unc saltem everso iuvenem succurrere seclo Ne prohibete.’ Augustus
