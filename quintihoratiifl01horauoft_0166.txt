INTRODUCTION TO THE CARMEN
SECULARE.

AMONG the antiquarian and religious revivals of Augustus, ’

Suetonius (Aug. 31) mentions the ‘Ludi Seculares’3 Dio (54.
18) fixes the date to the consulship of C. Furnius and C. Silanus, -
Rc. 17, but beyond this and the fact that it profe'ssed to be ,

their fifth celebration, he tells us nothing. No full account of *¹

thern is found earlier than Censorinus (de Die Natali, c. 5 ‘de
Seculo'), the writer on astrology in the second half of the 3rd

century, who is supplemented by Zosimus (2. 5), the historian‚

in the middle of the 5th century.

Tacitus (Ann. 11. 11) mentions their repetition in the reign ,
of Claudius, A.D. 46, but declines to describe thern, on the ⁵¹
ground that he has already given in the Histories (in one of ἵ
the Books now lost) a particular account of their celebration Ἴ
under Domitian, on which occasion he had had the sullest ¹

cognizance of their details, as being himself one of the ‘quin- ι

decimviri' and a praetor.

The games of which they professed to be the revival went ¹
under the Republic by the name of Tarentini (or Terentini) .
and Taurii, the former name being connected by all writers '⁴
with the ‘ stagna Tarenti' or ‘Terenti‚' a spot at the north edge ff

of the Campus Martius, near the river, once a swamp, and ΑΞ

probably a warm spring (see Bum's Rome and the Campagna‚
p. 300), the localityof some of the ceremonies even in Augustus' γ
celebration; the latter variously derived‚——by Servius (on Virg. ,

Aen. 2. 140), from the ‘taureae,' or sterile cows which were ἷν

sacrificed.

Their origin according to some of the authorities, according «³¹
to others their second celebration, was ascribed to Val. Pub· Ἀ
licola. All agree that they had only been celebrated four times
before the age of Augustus. There is no trace of the name ·
