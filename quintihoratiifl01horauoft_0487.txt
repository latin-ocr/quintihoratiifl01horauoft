ΝΟ TES. 4 5 1

bute of Diana cp. Od. 1. 21. 5, 3. 22. 1, Virg. Aen. 9. 405, etc„

Catull. 34. 9 soll.
5. Sibyllini versus. The books which were reported to have been

bought os the Sibyl by Tarquin had been destroyed in the burning of
the temple os Jupiter Capitolinus, 13.c. 82; but a fresh collection of
Sibylline prophecics had been made. Augustus had caused them to be
examined, and many that were deemcd spurious to be burnt. The re-
mainder were deposited by him in two gilt cases at the base of Apollo’s
statue in his temple on the l'alatine (Suet. Aug. 31). They were in the
keeping of the ‘ quindecimviri ’ (see on v. 70), who alone were allowed
to read them.

6. Both epithets apply to each substantive; see on Od. 3. 4. 18, 4. 9.
29. For the principles of the selection see extract from Zosim. l.
30 foll„ and cp. Od. 4. 6. 31 ⁴ Virginum primae puerique claris Patribus
orti.'

7. placuere. The perfect is regular: ‘in whose sight the seven hills
have found favour? It is more definite and final than ‘ placent!

10. The connection between the description and the prayer seems to
be, ‘unchangeable yourself, though you cause change and seem to
change, give to the pre-eminence of Rome the same unchangeabkness’

13. rite, probably ‘aster thine office’3 cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 36, 10. 254
‘aperire lenis ’; see App. 2, ξ 2.

14. Ilithyia, The Greek goddess of birth, identified subsequently
with Artemis. Horace offers two alternative Latin names : Lucina, ‘ she
that brings to the light‚' a name which Diana shared with Juno, though
‘ Iuno Lucina ' is sometimes treated as a name or phase of Diana herself,
as Catull. 34. 13 ‘Tu Lucina dolentibus Iuno dicta puerperis’; and
Genitalis, a title nowhere else given to her, though intelligible in itself,
possibly a Latinised form of Γενετυλλίς, a name given in this connection
to Aphrodite and Artemis. Bentley wished actually to read ⁶ Genetyllis.⁵
The choice of title offered to a god is common; cp. Catull. l. c.‚ especi-
ally v. 21 ‘Sis quocunque placet tibi Sancta nomine.' The prayer to
Ilithyia, as those to the Parcae (Μοῖραι), vv. 25-28‚ and to Tellus (Γαΐα),
vv. 29-32, were part of the prescribed ceremonia] ; see Zos. l. c. The
relation of stanzas 3 and 4 is pointed by the epithet with which stanza 3
begins: ‘Alme Sol‘; both deities are addressed as in different ways
‘life-giving’ powers. Rome's greatness cannot be separated from the
well-being and fruitfulness of Roman mothers. The male chorus
(according to Steiner and Ritter) take up the maiden‘s prayer, and apply
. it specially to Augustus' legislative efforts to encourage legitimate
marriage.

17. producas, ‘rear,’ as κουροτρόφος, Hes. Theog. 452.

18-20. The reference-is to the ‘Lex Iulia de maritandis ordinibus,’
