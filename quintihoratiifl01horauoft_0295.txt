No TES. BOOK Η, ODE J. 259

He was also one of the most accomplished rnen of the'age. Catullus
(12. 9) speaks of him in his youth as ‘leporum Disertus puer et
facetiarum.’ He is ranked among the great orators by Quintilian
(10. r. 113), Seneca (Epist. 100), and Tacitus (De Or. 38). His
tragedies are spoken of in high terms by Virgil (E. 8. 10 ‘sola Sophocleo
tua carmina digna cothurno’) and Horace (Sat. 1. 10. 42). His history
of the civil wars, from B.C. 60 to the establishment of Augustus’ power,
is referred to by Tacitus (Ann. 4. 34), Suetonius (Jul. Caes. 30).

We may notice the skill with which Pollio's various accomplishments
are worked incidentally into the Ode.

Line 1. motum, the stir of civil strife; Cicero’s word for a tumult or
rising, whether of a foreign or a domestic enemy.

ex Metello consule, from the consulship of Q. Caec. Metellus Celer
and L. Afranius, B.c. 60, the year of the league between Pompey‚ Crassus,
and Caesar, often called the F irst Triumvirate.

civicum, an archaic and, with the exception of the phrase ‘civica
corona‚’ almost exclusively poetical form of the more usual ‘civilis’
Cp. ‘hosticus ’ for ⁶ hostilis,' 3. 2. 6.

2. vitia, ‘crimes'

modos: ‘rationes,’ its shifting phases, now on land, now on sea, etc.

3. ludum Fortunae, Od. 3. 29. 50, 1. 2. 37.

graves principum amicitias, cp. Lucan 1. 84 ‘Tu causa malorum,
Facta tribus dominis communis Roma, nec unquam In turbam missi
feralia foedera regni. O male concordes ! ' etc. It must not be applied
to the triumvirate of Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, of which Horace
would not speak in such terms.

5. nondum expiatis, Od. 1. 2. 29.

cruoribus, plural of quantity, 2. 14. 25, Virg. Aen. 4. 687.

6. aleae, of hazards which no prudence can foresee. Horace's object
is not to discourage Pollio, but to exalt the value of the difficult task
which he is performing.

46. 2 πῦρ ὑπὸ τῇ σποδίῃ, Prop. 1. 5. 5 ‘ignotos vestigia serre per ignes?

9. severae, solemn, stately. Cp. Aristotle's epithets os Tragedy and
its subjects, σπουδαῖος, σεμνός.

11. ordinaris, aster the Greek συντάττειν, of composition. This is
the Scholiast's interpretation; but before Bentley the other commen-
tators took it toArnean, according to a common poetical figure, ‘tell of
the settlement of the State] Orelli's objection to this seems to be
forcible‚ that it would imply Pollio’s approval of Augustus? policy more
distinctly than Horace appears to intend.

1 2. Cecropio cothurno. For the abl. cp. v. 16 ‘Delmatico triumph0,'
