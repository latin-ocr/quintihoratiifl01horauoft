before used the image of a poet's ventures, G. 2. 41 ‘ pelagoque volans
da vela patenti,' and Ovid follows, Trist. 2. 328 ‘ Non ideo debet pelago

,The restoration ofagiiculture; ep.4.5. 18. ff*

6. nostro, opposed to the foreign gods, in whose temples they have
been hanging hitherto. The standards taken at Chartae were restored
in ac. 20; cp. Epp. 1. 18. 56.

9. Ianum Quirini. As Bentley shows, the usual name of this
passage and double gateway (Burn's Rome, pp. xxiv and 87), which
was opened in time of war and closed in time of peace, was ‘Ianus
Quirinus‚' ‘Quirinus’ being apparently an adjective, as in ‘Ianus Ge-
minus,' ‘ Ianus Iunonius: etc. It is open therefore to suppose either
that the genitive was used indifferently with the adjective as=‘0f
Romulus ’ tto whom the worship of Janus was attributed), ‘ of Rome,'
‘Roman,’ or that Horace consciously varies the usual form, as he does
technical expressions so often ; see on 3. 5. 42.

10. frena licentiae iniecit3 3. 24. 29.

1 2. artes ; ‘ Imperium facile his artibus retinetur quibus initio partum
est,‘ Sall. Cat. 2. 4. They are the virtues of old Roman life celebrated
in 3. 1-6. For ‘artes ’ cp. 3. 3. 9 ‘Hac arte Pollux,' etc. As Kritz
explains on the passage in Sallust, the word only=‘studia ac mores,'
and must draw its positive colour from the context. We need not think,
with many of Horace’s editors, of the possible etymological connection
of ‘ ars’ with ἀρετή. If the end proposed were bad, ‘artes' would be
viceS.

14. imperi; see on 1. 2. 26.

15. ortus. There is a v. l. of less authority, ‘orturus' It is a case
clearly where either singular or plural is admissible, and where variety
is quite a sufficient motive to account sor their interchange. Bentley
quotes Sall. Cat. 36 ‘cum ad occasus ab ortu solis omnia domita armis
parerent.’

17. eustode; 3.14.15, 4. 5. 1.

18. exiget, in its simple sense, ‘drive out,' as 2. 13. 31 ‘exactos
‘tyrannos' B has ‘ exigit '; V, unmetrically, ‘ exegit? Some form of the
verb was certainly read by Porph., who interprets ‘excludet, quasi ἔξω
agit, ut Terentius: spectandae cm exigendae) There is good MS.
authority also for ‘eximet‚⁷ which is preferred by Ritter, Keller, and
Mr. Munro3 and it is a common Horatiau word, Od. 2. 2. 19, 3. 14. 14,
Epp. 1. 5. 18, 2. 2. 212, though this is hardly an argument for it here.

20. miseras, prolepfficassy, ‘ to their misery?

inimicat, ‘sets at x⁷aria11ce‚' a word, apparently, as Porph. tells us
(ζ fictum verbum est '), coined by Horace.

21. For the form of expression see on 3. 10. 1; cp. 2. 2. 20 ‘Rhodani
