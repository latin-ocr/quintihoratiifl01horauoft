340 ΗΘΚΛ TII CARMJNA.

This Ode is the complement of the last. It traces to its source the ’
decline of the military spirit of which that complained, and includes in 2

the arraignment Roman daughters and mothers. As that points to i

Augustus' plan of foreign conquest, so this points to* his restoration of ,

temples and religious ceremonial (cp. 2. 15) and his legislation on social

questions (cp. 3. 243 4. 5. 21 foll.; Carm. Sacc. 17, 20). Cp. Suet. ¹

Aug. 30, and Merivale, ch. 33.

Line 1. immeritus, not that Horace would say generally that the
existing generation was innocent, but their punishment was not all for ἵ
their own sins. In part they were ⁶ paying sor the sins of their sires in
which they had had no share‚’ and would continue to pay sor them till
they undid them.

2. Romane, a general address to the people‚ Sat. 1. 4. 85 ; cp. A. P.
54, Virg. Aen. 6. 852.

templa . . . aedesque, synonyms, the second substantive being only a
vehicle for the epithet‚ like Virgil's ‘ Limen erat caecaeque fores . . .
postesque relicti.’

refeceris, the task that Augustus was engaged in, Suet. Aug. 30 ¹
‘ Aedes sacras vetustate collapsas aut incendio absumtas resecit.’

4. fumo, perhaps from the ‘ incendia’ of which Suet. l. e. speaks.

5. te minorem geris; cp. 1. 12. 57 ‘ Te minor latum reget aequus or-
bem.'

6. hinc, sc. ‘est.’ Liv. 45. 39 ‘maiores vestri omnia magnarum ,
rerum et principia exorsi ab Dis sunt et finem statuerunt? It is the
forgetfulness of this which has constituted the ‘neglect’ of the next
verse.

For the scansion of principium see on 3. 4. 41.

7. neglecti, ‘ because they were forgotten‚’ 3. 2. 30 ‘ Diespiter
neglectus?

9. bis Monaeses et, Pacori manus, Three defeats of Roman y
armies by the Parthians are recorded‚—that of Crassus at Chartae by
Surenas, B.c. 53; that of Decidius Saxa, legatus os M. Antony, in Syria ,
by Pacorus the son of Orodes, and Labienus the republican renegade, in ἶ
ac. 403 and that ofM. Antony in Media in B.c. 36. Pacorus himself
had been killed in battle in B.C. 38. The only Monaeses known to ,
history was the Parthian noble who, having fied, like many others, from ¹
the tyranny of Phraates IV (the son to whom Orodes I in his grief at
the death of Pacorus had resigned the crown), instigated Antony to
his ill-advised invasion of Parthia in nc, 36. It has been suggested
that Monaeses may have been the name of the general who defeated ¹
Crassus, ‘Surenas ’ being not so much a name as a title, as it appears to
have been certainly in later times: Σουρήνας . . . ἀρχῆς δὲ τοῦτο παρὰ
