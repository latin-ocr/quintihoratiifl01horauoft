302 HORATJJ CARMINA.

in orbe: Quem cum per etuo vestivit lumine Titan Brumali flectens
contorquet tempore currum.' The ‘ western waters‚' as in Od. 1. 28. 26.
Lord Lytton thinks that in suggesting Capricorn for their horoscope
Horace is thinking of his narrow escape from shipwreck, Od. 3. 4. 28.

22. impio connects the crimes of the mythological Saturn with the
bad influence of the planet which bears his name. Orelli shows from
Manil. 2. 434 and 4. 698 that ‘tutela' was a technical term.

23. Saturno. Orelli and Dissr. seem right in thinking that the
dative feels the government both of ‘eripuit ’ and of ‘ refulgens ' in the
sense of ·’ shining in the face of,' so as to counteract his influence.

26. ter, indefinite, of several rounds of applause. The plural ‘theatris'
generalizeS, ‘the people in crowded theatres'3 in Od. 1. 20. 3, where
he refers to the event more particularly, he uses the singular. We need
not press the fact that there was at the time apparently only one
theatre in Rome. Ritter thinks it necessary to join ‘laetum theatris '=
¹ quo gaudent theatra) For the phrase ‘ crepuit sonum ’ cp. Propert. 4.
10. 4 ‘ manibus faustos ter crepuere sonos.⁷

27. truncus, Od. 2. 13 passim, 3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8.

28. sustulerat. The indicative is a rhetorical exaggeration, ‘I was
dead, had not Faunus stayed the blow,' cp. Od. 3. 16. 3 ‘munierant . .
si non risissent’; Virg. G. 2. 133, Aen. 2. 55; see Madv. ξ 348 c.

FaunuS, cp. Ι. 17. 2, 13, the god of the country, here probably as
there identified with Pan, for Pan was the son of Hermes, which may
explain the connection of ‘ Mercurialium? Horace attributes his escape
in 3. 8. 7 to Bacchus: the constant part in all his references to it is its
ground, ‘Dis pietas mea Et musa cordi est.’

29. Mercurialium. ‘Mercuriales’ was the name of a ‘collegium
mercatorum’ at Rome, which was associated with the ‘cultus’ of
Mercurius, the god of traffic‚ Cic. ad Quint. Fr. 2. 5, Liv. 2. 21, 27:
the word was thus familiar to people’s ears as meaning ‘favourites of
Mercury.’ Horace applies it in Sat. 2. 3. 25 to Damasippus, the
connoisseur who could buy everything so as to make a profit, from old
bronzes to estates: and here (Mercury being identified with the Greek
Hermes) to himself, as under the special protection of the god who

was ‘curvae lyrae pare1is,¹ Od. 1. 10. 6, 3. 11. 1, Epod. 13. 9, etc. Cp.
also Od. 2. 7. 13.

ODE XVIII.

‘I have no ivory couches nor gilded ceiling nor rare marbles nor
palace nor crowd of retainers. Yet Ι have honour and wit and the
respect of those richer than myself, and I am contented. You lay
house to house as if you were to live for ever. The land is not large
enough, you must build in the sea. Nay, you must pluck up your
