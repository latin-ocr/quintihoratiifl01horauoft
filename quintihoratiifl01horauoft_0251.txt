the difference of sense which we are thus obliged to put on the future
here and in v. 1, ‘potabis' Keller prints ‘Tum bibes,’ a conj. of
Doederlein's, which seems to be the reading of the best MS. of Por-
phyrion’s scholia on Sat. 2. 2. 48, where this verse is quoted. He
explains it (Rhein. Mus. vol. xix. p. 212) to mean, ‘Then, after the
flask of Sabine, you shall have some Caecuban: you should have
Falernian if Ι had any.’ But the sense is dull; it is hardly possible
to doubt the antithesis ‘ Tu’ . . ‘mea '; and Caecuban is usually a
type of the most expensive sort of second class wine (see Od. 2. 14. 25,
etc.) He had previously (Rhein. Mus. vol. xviii. p. 274) supported
‘Tu bibis,’ the quantity of the ι’ being justified by ‘scribis‚’ Sat. 2.
3. 1. Mr. Munro has (Journal of Philology, 1871, p. 350) proposed
from a reading ‘bides' in a Paris MS. of the loth century (λ), to
restore ‘vides’ in the sense of ‘ you provide.’ Cp. Cic. ad Att. 5. Ι. 3
‘ut prandium nobis videret? and Ter. Heaut. 3. 1. 48 ‘Quid vini ab-
sumsit! Sic hoc, dicens, asperum, Pater, hoc est: aliud lenius sodes
vide. Relevi dolia omnia, omnes serias‚’ a passage which Mr. Munro
thinks may have unconsciously suggested to Horace the ‘levi' of v. 3
as well as the ⁴ vides ’ of this verse.

11. temperant. Properly the man who mixes the wine and water
is said ‘temperare pocula! The vines and hills are here said to do so
because they produce the grapes which are used for the purpose.

ODE XXI.

Compare Catull. 34 ‘ Dianae sumus in fide‚' etc.

Several occasions have been imagined for this Ode. The Pseudo.-
Acr. associated it with the Ludi Seculares, nc. 17, and it was accord-
ingly treated by several editors as an introduction to the Carm. Sec.

, Franke assigns it to B.C. 28, the year in which Augustus dedicated
the temple to Apollo 011 the Palatine (Od. 1. 31), and instituted the
quinquennial Ludi Actiaci in honour of Apollo and Diana. He thinks
the Ode was written for their first celebration.

Orelli considers it a mere exercise of fancy, suggested perhaps by
some such occasion as the games of B.C. 28, but not of sufficient weight
to have been composed for public performance.
