NOTES. BOOK J, ODE XXXIV. 24 3

10. sie visum Veneri, of mysterious ‘ dispensations'3 as Acron
says, ‘quotiescunque ratio non apparet “ sic visum'' interponitur, ut
Vergilius (Aen. 3. 1) “ Postquam res Asiae Priamique evertere regnum
Immeritum visum superis.’' ’ Here there is a half-comio irony in the
solution. Sophocles' Chorus are more serious in their explanation of
the troubles caused by love: ἄμαχος γὰρ ἐμπαίζει θεὸς Ἀφροδίτα, Antig.
800, a Play with which Horace was familiar, see on Od. 4. 13. 8. Com-
pare the sport of Mars, Od. 1. 2. 393 of Fortune, 3. 29. 503 and of
Venus herself, 3. 27. 67 soll.

11. iuga aenea, ‘a yoke they cannot break.' Od. 3. 9. 17 ‘quid si
prisca redit Venus, Diduetosque iugo cogit aeneos

13. melior Venus, on Od. 1. 27. 14. ‘ Melior' is interpreted by the
description given of Myrtale's rank and temper.

14. grata compede; so again, Od. 4. 11. 23.

15. aerior, ⁶ more passionate,⁷ as Virgil's ‘ acri Lycurgo,' Aen. 3. 14,
translates Sophocles' ὀξύχολος παῖς Δρίιαντος, Ant. 955.

Hadriae, Od. 3. 9. 23 ‘ improbo iracundior Hadria.’

16. curvantis Calabros sinus, ‘that breaks into eurving bays the
Calabrian shore.' Luc. 8. 177 ‘ Scythiae curvantem litora Pontum? It
is the proof of the force os the sea, and so of the passion of which it is
the similitude. ‘ Sinus ³ is the accus. of the result rather than the object,
as Virgil says, ‘rumpere vocem,' Aen. 2. 129; ‘rumpere aditus,’ ib. 2.
494; as well as ‘ rumpere silentium,' ‘ claustra,’ etc. Horace is thinking
of the great Tarentine gulf. The words have also been taken, with
less probability, of ‘ cresting the water‚’ like Homer's κυρτωθὲν κῦμα,
Od. 11. 2443 κῦμα κυρτὸν ἐὰν κορυφοῦται, 11. 4. 4263 Virgil’s ‘ Tollimur
in caelum curvato gurgite‚’ Aen. 3. 564: ‘sinus' in this case being
either the water of the Calabrian bays, or the hollow of the waves them-
selves. For this last, cp. Virg. G. 4. 361 ‘Curvata in montis faciem
circumstetit unda, Accepitque sinu vasto misitque sub undam? The
true parallel, however, is Virgil's constant epithet, ⁵ litore curvo.’

ODE XXXIV.

‘I surrender my old Epicurean doctrine of the “careless'’ gods
(Sat. 1. 5. 101). Ι have heard thunder not where Lucretius might
explain it to me from clashing clouds, but in a cloudless sky, where Ι
could not but recognise it as the rolling of the chariot wheels that shake
all creation. It is the same hand that launches “bolts from a clear

sky’' in human things, that lifts the humble and overthrows the proud
when men least expect it.’

Horace is thinking probably of the challenge with which Lucretius
clenches his argument that thunder comes from purely natural causes :—
