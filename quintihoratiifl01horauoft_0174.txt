GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
EPODES.

‘LIBER EPODON,’ ‘Liber Vtus qui Epodon inscribitur‚' are
the titles by which this Book is headed in MSS, and cited by
the grammatical and metrical writers of the 4th and 5th cen-
turies‚ Marius Victorinus, Diomedes, Fortunatianus. The
separate poems are called Odae. The word Epode (ἐπῳδός)
was a recognized metrical term for the shorter verse of a
couplet, which is as it were the echo (ἐπᾴδεται, ‘accinitur') of ‘a
the longer one, and then συνεκδοχικῶς for the metre or poem ἵ
(more properly ‘carmen epodicum') in which such a sequence
occurred ¹. Elegiac verses are thus admitted as Epodic by Vic-
torinus (p. 2300), but in common use the term was appropriated
to the couplet metres of Archilochus and their Horatian imi-
tations. It may be noticed that such metres are not peculiar
to the so-called ‘Epodes.' Two of the couplets known specially
by Archilochus' name occur only in the Odes (Ι. 4, and 4. 7);
the latter is the one example of an ‘Epodus' quoted from
Horace by Terentianus Maurus.

Horace's own name for these poems is ‘lambi’ (Epod. 14. 7,
Od. 1. 16. 3 and 24, Epp. 1. 19. 25), a term which implied their '
character at least as much as their metre (cp. the Greek verb :⁴

sometimes to the first line of a couplet, as the Hexarneter in ElegiacS‚
sometimes to the first line only when it is the shorter of the two. as in
Od. 2. 18; but ‘Epodus' is used often to cover such couplets as this.
Various attempts have been made to find other meanings for the term .
‘ Liber Epodon ' as applied to Horace's poems. Scaliger (Poet. 1. 44),
ignoring apparently the chronological difficulty, interpreted it to mean
⁶ after Odes.' Torrentius made the word a case of ἑπῳδή, ‘ liber incan- ·⁴
tationuin,' a general name given to the book from the character of two
of its most important poems‚ Epod. 5 and 17.
