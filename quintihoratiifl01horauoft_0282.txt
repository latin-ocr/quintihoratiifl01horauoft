246 HORATII CARMJNA.

ODE XXXV.

The Fortuna of this Ode, as has been already suggested, is a different
conception from that of the last. She is the author of the vicissitudes
of life, but not in sport (as in Od. 3. ²9- 49), or at random, as the blind
chance—goddess. The apparent capriciousness is that of a hidden will,
and its decisions have the fixity of fate. Through any confusion of
image in vv. 21-28 (see on v. 24) the thought seems clear, that her
attributes are moral. ‘Her frown does not drive away hope nor ex-
tinguish any but mercenary affection.’ Her purposes are moral, and
the greatness of Rome is amongst them. This gives their relevancy to
the later stanzas. ⁴ The rule of Caesar is the cessation of civil blood-
shed‚ the restoration of religion, the turning of Roman arms to their
legitimate aim of conquering the world. T lzercjfore F ortune is invoked
to protect him and his plans.’

One of the chief conceptions of Fortune to a Roman was the
‘ Fortuna publica,’ ‘ Fortuna populi Romani,' the Fortune described in
Plutarch's image (de Fortuna Romanorum, c, 4): ‘even as Aphrodite,
when she crossed the Eurotas, laid aside her mirror and her ornaments
and her cestus, and took spear and shield to adom herself for Lycurgus’
eyes, so when, after her sojourning with Persians and Assyrians, with
Macedonians and Carthaginians, she (τύχη) approached the Palatine
and crossed the Tiber, she laid aside her wings and took off her sandals
and left behind her ball, the symbol of fickleness and change.’

Line 1. gratum, sc. ‘ tibi? ‘your loved Antium,’ as ‘dilectam Cypron,’
Od. 1. 30. 2. Horace imitates the common mode of addressing a Greek
god or goddess by the title of some chief seat of their worship, ‘ O quae
beatam diva tenes Cyprum‚' Od. 3. 26. 9, etc. There was at Antium
a famous temple of Fortuna, or rather apparently of the Fortunae, who
were represented as two sisters, 'veridicae sorores,' Mart. 5. 1. 3, whose
images were consulted as an oracle; cp. Suet. Cal. 57.

2. praesenS, not elsewhere used with an infinstive, but found not
uncommonly in the sense of ⁴ powerful‚' ‘prompt to any purpose.'

3. mortale corpus, ‘to lift from the dust a frail mox-tal man, and to
change to a funeral train the proud triumphal procession.’ ‘Mortale’
corresponds to ‘funeribus’ Put man at his lowest, she can yet raise
him to glory; put him at his highest, a touch of her hand brings him
down to dust again. ‘ Funeribus’ is the ablative‚ ‘vertere seria ludo,’
A. P. 226, after the analogy of ‘mutare’

5. pauper. There seems to be suggested a double oppositi0n‚ the
rich and the poor, the landsman and the sailor, though, after Horace's
