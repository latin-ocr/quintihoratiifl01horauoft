the corruption found in a few, ‘minantium.’ Bentley suggests as a
parallel sor that reading, Ov. Trist. 4. 2. 21 soll. ‘Vinclaque captiva
reges cervice gerentes Ante coronatos ire videbit equos: Et cernet
vultus aliis pro tempore verSOS, Terribiles aliis immemoresque sui ' ; but
he prefers the vulg. himself, and quotes Od. 2. 7. 11, where ‘ minaces ‘ is
used in just the same contrast ; ⁸ that just now threatened so high?

13. dulcis, the accusative. He praises Licymnia's sweet singing,
bright eyes, and true heart.

dominae, ‘your mistress.¹ ‘Adolescentum more qui amatas “domi-
nas'’ vocant,’ Acr. Horace would hardly (as Ritter supposes) call
Terentia (is it be she) ‘my mistress’ because he calls Maecenas (not
‘ dominus‚' but) ‘ rexque pate1·que‚' Epp. 1. 7. 32- For ‘ domina‚' used
of a wife, Orelli quotes Ov. Trist. 5. 3. 28.

Licymniae. The name occurs in Virg. Aen. 9. 564 ‘serva Licymnia.'

14. lucidum fu1gentes, 1. 22. 23 ‘dulce ridentem?

15. bene. Either ‘ wisely,' with ‘ fidum‚’ ‘ mutuis ' giving the reason
why her loyalty is wise; or only Ξ ‘ rames as ‘ mentis bene sanae,⁷ Sat.
Ι. 9. 44, a use which is found in Cicero, and to which Orelli traces the
French ‘bien.⁷ In this case it may qualify ‘fidum' or ‘mutuis,' ex-
pressing the completeness either of her loyalty or of the reciprocity of
their love. The former more likely, as from its position we want it
rather to balance than to strengthen ‘mutuis’; and also because the
main topic is praise of Licymnia, not of Maecenas.

17—20. See Introd. ‘Nee dedecuit ¹ suggests rather the idea of eon-
descension.

19. nitidis, in holiday dress.

sacro Dianae celebris die, ‘the sacred day that fills Diana's
temple.’

21. AchaemeneS, the mythical founder of the Achaemenid family,
and so standing sor a Persian king; 3. 9. 4 ‘ Persarum vigui rege beatior.'
Horace uses the adjective ‘Achaemenius’ for ‘Persian,’ Od. 3. Ι. 44,
Epod. 13. S.

22. Mygdonias, ‘Mygdon's wealth in fat Phrygia? Cp. Od.'3. 16. 41.
Mygdon is a prince of the Phrygians in Hom. Il. 3. 186.

24. Arabum, see Od. 1. 29 Introd„ 3. 24. 2, Epp. 1. 7. 36.

26. sacili, that yields easily.

27. poscente magis, ‘ more than you who ask for them.'

gaudeat, occupet, are subjunctive because they give the reason
for the epithet ‘facili saevitia) Bentley would read ‘occupat' with
a minority of the MSS„ returning to the construction of ‘detorquet,

28. rapere occupet, ‘be the first to snatchs For the infinitive see

App. 2, ξ 1.
