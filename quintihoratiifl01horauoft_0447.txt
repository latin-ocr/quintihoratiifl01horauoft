For the use of ‘ in‘ cp. Virg. E. 8. 83, Aen. 2. 541, ‘Talis iu hoste suit
Priamo,’ Madv. ξ 230, obs. 1.

5. olim seems to answer, as Ritter thinks, to ‘iam,' ‘mox‚' ‘nunc‚’
which mark stages in the young bird's progress3 so that it will mean
πάλαι, ‘long agos and is defined by ‘laborum inscium,' ‘ere yet he knew
life's labours.‘ It is otherwise taken as merely generalising—-aie-rdv
τινα, ποτέ; see on Epod. 3. 1.

iuventas et patrius vigor, ‘ his young blood and the force of his

ragi- propulit. So Cruq. on the authority of two of his Bland. MSS„

and it is accepted by all recent editors; the larger number of MSS.
have ‘protulit.’ The time of the perfect tenses is that of the Greek
aorist in similes.

7. verni. Bentley feels strongly the objection raised by Jul. Caes.
Scaliger, that eaglets are not hatched till late in the spring, and would
not be fit to fly far till autumn. He prefers ‘vei-nis,’ which has some
MS. support, and which he judges to have been the reading of Acron,
from his illustration ⁶ ut ‘⁵ ruit imbriferum ver ’'.’ Probably ‘ nimbis re-
motis’ is enough to account for the Scholiast's quotation3 the sound
and balance of the sentence are in favour of ‘vernis We need not
expect Horace to date the eaglet's growth with the accuracy of an
ornithologist. He is more likely to use the epithet ‘vernus’ in a
pleasing sense of the soft breezes, thau in association merely with
storms. ‘Verni’ need not mean the first days of spring, nor is the
eaglet said yet to be fit for hunting ; it is of the first stage in the art of
flying. For a conj. alteration of Horace's text on somewhat similar
grounds see 1. 23. 5.

10. vividus impetus, of the actual rusb, swoop, of his descent;
‘ demittit impetus aquilam ’ :⁶ aquila cum impetu defertur.' It has also
been taken of his impetuous temper; but it suits Horace's economy of
words that the motive in this clause should be gathered from the ‘amor
dapis atque pugnae’ (a dainty banquet‚ with the excitement of fighting
for it) of the second clause, the mode of attack in that clause from the
‘vividus impetus' of this, as the unresisting weaknezss of the sheep is
left to be inferred from the epithet given to the serpents. See on 2. 3. 9,

ΙΙ. dracones. For the favourite image ofa battle between an eagle
and a serpent cp. Hom. Il. 12. 200 soll„ Aesch. Cho. 247 foll„ Soph.
Ant. 125.

14. fulvae matris ab ubere. Some awkwardness has been felt in
this expression, as, if we construet it with ‘depulsum,' either ‘ab ubere ‘
or ‘lacte' would seem to be redundant (cp. Virg. E. 7. 17 ‘depulsos a
lacte‚’ G. 3. 187 ‘depulsus ab ubere matris '), and various modes of
