NOTES. B'OOKII, ODE VI. 271

14. dempserit, apponet, a ground for not being impatient. ‘ If you
are losing the years fast, she is gaining them as sast.' Each fresh year
os life is a year added or a year taken away, according to our point os
view. Compare the double phrase by which Horace expresses the lapse os
time in Od. 3. 30. 5 ‘annorum series et suga temporum.’ So Seneca de
(jons. ad Marc. 20 ‘Quo quisque primum lucem vidit iter mortis in-
gressus est, accessitque fato propi01·; et illi ipsi qui adiiciebantur
adolescentiae anni vita detrahebantur.’ Cp. Soph. Aj. 476 παρ’ ἦμαρ
ἡμέρα . . Προσθεῖσα κάναθεῖσα τοῦ ’γε κατθανεῖν. To the impatient lover
time seems to be robbing him of year after year, and to be making no
difference to Lalage, to be ‘ galloping' with him while it ‘ crawls' or
stands still with her, cp. Epp. 1. 1. 20 foll. Such expressions as A. P.
175 ‘anni venientes, recedentes' (cp. Od. 2. 11. 5), Soph. Traeh. 547
ὁρῶ μὲν ἥβην τὴν μὲν ἕρπουσαν πρόσω Τὴν δὲ φθίνουσαν are not in point.
They refer not to disserent ways of viewing the same time, but to dif-
ferent epochs of life. They suppose an ἀκμή, a definite point to which
lise ascends and from which it descends. Horace does not mean here
to represent his lover as going down the hill of life.

15. proterva fronte, a return to the metaphor of stanzas 1, 2.

17. dilecta, sc. ‘ a te.’ ‘ Lalage, whom you love with a passion you
never felt sor any other.' His pre-eminent love for Lalage is the measure
both of the happiness for which he is bidden to wait and of the im—
patience with which he waits sor it.

Pholoe fugax, see on Od. 1. 5. 36 ‘ asperam Pholoen? Her flight
is one which attracts pursuit, ‘ fugit ad salices et se cupit ante videris

non, non, ve, cp. Od. 2. 9. 1⁴6 ‘non‚' ‘ aut‚' ‘ nee,' ‘ aut.'

19. pura, Od. 3. 29· 45 ⁸ sole puro,y free from mist or cloud.

renidet, in what is its first sense, ‘ shines again '; Od. 2. 18. 2
‘aureum . . renidet lacunar⁷3 Epod. 2. 66 ‘renidentes 1ares.’

22. mire, with ‘ falleret.’

hospites, strangers who carne in.

ODE VI.

‘ Septimius, my dear friend who would accompany me to the ends of
‘the earth, let me spend the end of my life at Tibur, or if not there, then
at Tarentum. Let us go there together and live there till 1 dies

Septimius has been naturally supposed to be the same person whom
Horace introduces to Tiberius in Epp. 1. 9. The Schol. Cruq. further
identifies him with Titius, the poet on the staff of the same Tiberius in
Epp. 1. 3. 9 ‘ Romana brevi venturus in ora, Pindarici fontis qui non
expalluit haustus.’ ” It may probably be the same person who is named
