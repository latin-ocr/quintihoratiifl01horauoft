NOTES. BOOK J, ODE l. 163

6. terrarum dominos The interpretation os these words must
depend to a great extent on the decision of the question discussed
in the next note. (1) If the punctuation given in the text is adopted,
so that v. 6 belongs to the preceding sentence, they may best be taken
with Dillcnburger as = ‘quasi sint facti terrarum domini‚’ ‘raises them to
heaven, very lords of the world‚’ i.e. in their own feeling and estimation.
Cp. Od. 4. 2. 17 ‘quos Elea domum reducit Palma caelestes.' Ovid (ex
Pont. 1. 9. 36) gives the title ‘ Terrarum domini ’ to the gods themselves,
and so it is taken here by many editors. The force would really be the
same; for to name a special characteristic of the gods is in effect to
qualify the sense of ‘ evehit ad deos,' ‘ raises them to the gods in so far
as the gods are “terrarum domini,”' ‘makes them like gods, lords of
the world.' A less probable view, following Lucan's use of the words
(8. 208, os Eastein princes), makes them the direct object of ‘evehit ' and
understands them of the princes celebrated by Pindar, as Hiero, Thero,
etc. (2) If the verse belongs to the sentence which follows, ‘Terrarum
‹lominos' may be taken, according to the suggestion first made by
Glareanus, as a designation of the Romans who are contrasted with
the Greeks, the objects of the preceding verses. Cp. the contrast of
the two peoples in the parallel Od. 4. 3. 3-9. The expression would
then be the same as Virgil's ‘Romanos rerum dominos‚' Aen. 1. 282;
but Mr. Yonge rightly points out that in Vir-gil it is used of the Romans
(ollcclz'vely, and that we still lack proof that it could have been tolerated
if used, as it would be here, of z'ndiw'duals.

7—9. hune . . illum. We must supply ‘ iuvat' from v. 4. The inter—
position of the fresh verb ‘evehit’ has been felt to be a difficulty.
Bentley avoided it by altering ‘evehit' to ‘evehere,’ which he took
With ‘nobilis‚’ as ‘superare pugnis nobilem‚’ Od. Ι. 12. 24. Rutgers
had previously suggested the course which has been followed lately by
Macleane and Munro, supported by ‘the emphatic advocacy of Dr.
Kennedy.’ They put a full stop at ⁴ nobilis,' making ‘evehit’ the verb
of the new sentence, and ‘huncss ‘ illum ’ the distribution of the collective
accusative ‘ terrarum dominos,’ in the sense of ⁶ the Romans ς’ see pre-
ceding note. The serious objection to this view lies in the break of
rhythm, resulting in an anti<climax, caused by stopping at ‘nobilis'
The parallels which Mr. Munro alleges, such as Ι. 30. 5, quite dispose of
any difficulty which may have been raised against the break in the fifth
line of the system, but they leave untouched the poverty of ‘ palmaque
nobilis' if it is the subject of the preceding verb, the last in a series
which descends both in fulness of sense and in weight of sound.

7. mobilium. The epithet, if it reflects the poet's own feeling (cp.
Epp. 1. 19. 34 ‘ventosae plebis,' Od. 3. 2. 20 ‘popularis aurae ⁵), suits
also the feeling of the poem. It is the parallel of the ‘dust ’ os v. 3, the
