NOTES. BOOK III, ODE XVII. 365

whom thou tracest thine origin.' In other words, ‘Since all the Lamiae.
ancient and modern, are descended from him, doubtless you are.' The
omission of ‘tu’ before ‘ducis,’ although the person is emphatic, is
paralleled in Od. 2. 17. 30. Cp. 1. 1. 35, 4. 2. 53. ‘Ducit,’ constr. as
the verb after ‘genus omne,’is an emendation of D. Heinsius (1580-
1655) strongly advocated by Bentley. It has no MS. authority, but has
been received by several editors (Keller and Mr. Munro amongst them).
and has the merit of making the parenthesis run more smoothly.

hinc, ‘from him.’ Sat. 1. 4. 6. Orelli quotes Virg. Aen. 1. 21 ‘Hinc
populum . . venturum.⁷ Cp. the use of ‘ unde,’ Od. 1. 12. 17.

4. memores fastos3 4. 14. 4. The MSS. vary between ‘fastos ' and
‘fastus‚' a form which was also in use. Lucan. 10. 187 ‘Nec meus
Eudoxi vincetur fastibus annus)

5. auctore, of the founder of a family; 1. 2. 36, Virg. Aen.

7. innantem Maricae litoribus, refers to the marshes near Min-
turnae, at the mouth of the Liris (Garigfflmo), known in history as the
place where Marius was for a time concealed. Marica was a nymph
worshipped at Minturnae, identified by some with Circe.

9. late ‘cy-rannus, εὐρυκρείων. Virg. Aen. 1. 21 ‘ populum late regem?

10. inutili, not, as Dill1'. complains, an epithet quite without bearing
on the context. It helps to make us feel the dreariness and odiousness
of the storm out of doors‚ which is to contrast with the cheer which
there may be within. Its work is purely destructive3 it brings down the
leaves which are of use, and strews the shore with seaweed which is
,of no use.

12. aquae augur3 3. 27. 10 ‘imbrium divina avis imminentum.'

13. anuosa3 4.13. 24

potes, so the majority of‹ good MSS. Bentley prefers‘ potis, the
reading of a few, as a word which, though admissible (cp. Virg Aen.
3. 671), ls yet rare, and therefore unlikely to have been substituted for
an easier one.

15. curabis. The future seems to have the force of ‘of course you
will.’ ‘Curabis Genium’ is an extension of the 'common ‘curare se
ipsum‚' ‘curare corpus? When the Genius was viewed more distinctly
as something external to and separate from the person whose spiritual
double it was, it was said rather ‘placari‚⁷ ‘piari fioribus et vino.’ Cp.
A. P. 210, Epp. 2. 1. 144.

16. operum. For genitive cp. 2. 9. 17, 3. 27. 69, Madv. ξ 261,
obs. 4.
