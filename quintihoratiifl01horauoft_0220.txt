Orelli takes it ‘to pluck the olive sor a crown from every quarter of Attio
soil‚’ i. e. to sing of every myth, event, glory of art, that adorn Athens.

8. plurimus. There seems to be no other instance of ‘plurimus'
without a subst. sor ‘ plurimi.’ Ritter will not allow the use, and
takes ‘ plurimus in Iunonis honorem' as=‘eft'usus in‚‘ as ‘multus esse
in re nota,' Cic de Or. 2. 87. But if virgil says ‘plurimus oleaster‚'
G. 2. 182, and Lucan, 3. 707, ⁴ multus sua vulnera puppi Affixit mo-
riens‚’ ‘ plurimus' may well be used sor the plural here.

segetes? Od. 1. 31. 3, Virg. Aen. 2. 782.

12. domus Albuneae. See Mr. Burn's account of Tivoli in ‘ Rome
and the Canipagna,' pp. 394 foll. He identifies it not vrith the ‘temple
of the Sibyl,' as it is commonly called. but with the second ancient
temple, now the church of S. Giorgio, which stands close to it on the
brink of the precipitous ravine through which the ‘old sall' of the
Anio descends. The topography of Tibur is especially difficult on
account of the changes which great inundations have caused in the
course os the Anio. One such is described in Plin. Epp. 8. 17.
Another, in A.D. 1826, led to the excavation of the tunnels through
the Monte Catillo, by which the larger part of the river is now con-
ducted to the ‘new salls’ beyond the reach of the rocks on which the
town is built.

last of the Sibyls. ΜΓ. Burn thinks that Yirg. Aen. 7. 82 ‘lucosque
sub alta Consulit Albunea,' etc.. refers not to Tibur but to some sul·
phureous springs near Laurentum.

13. Tiburni, acc. to Virg. Aen. 7. 672, Tiburnus (Virg. calls him
‘ Tiburtus ’), Catillus t‘CatilusJ Hor. Od. 1. IS. 2), and Coras were
three Argive brothers, founders os Tibur.

14. mobilibus rivis. Burn. l. c. ‘ A third portion of the Anio is
diverted just above the bridge into canals apparently of very ancient
date, which, passing completely through the centre of the town, are used
as the motive power of watermills of every kind and then fall again (the
falls known as the ‘¹ Cascatelle‘') into the main stream at various points
of the romantic cliffs on the western hill side.’
