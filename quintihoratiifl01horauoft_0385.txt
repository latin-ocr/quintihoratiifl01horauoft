NOTES. BOOKIII, ODE X. 349

tunde, pity, jealousy—will make you love me, yet as a goddess be
merciful. O, hard and cruel beart! there are limits to your lover's
patience.‘

Compare with the Ode 4. 13, which seems to be the rcvenge which is
here threatened.

Metre-Fourth Asclepz'ad.

Line 1. Tanain si biberes, 2. 20. 20 ‘Rhodani potor'; 4. 15. 13
‘qui Danubium bibunt? The form of expression is as old as Hom. 11.
2. 825 πίνοντες ὕδωρ μέλαν Αἰσήποιο. · If you were a Scythian, with a
husband as stern as husbands are there.' Cp. 3. 24. 20-25 ‘peccare
nefas aut pretium est mori.’ Lyce’s husband is of a different kind,
v. 15.

2. asperas, morally, ‘ shut in my face?

3. ineolis, ‘native‚’ sc. to Scythia. Horace suggests, though he
does not say, that the north wind to—night. is as cold as that of Scythia.

5. nemus. This is usually taken of the few trees which in a large
house were planted within the ‘peristylium’; see on Epp. 1. 10. 23
⁴ inter varias nutritur silva columnas.' Ritter contends that Lyce is not
in the rank of lise to which such an appendage of a palace would be
appropriate, and takes it of some public plantation, such as the ‘duo
luci ’ <Liv. 1. 8), between the two tops of the Capitoline.

6. inter pulchra tecta, ‘ Though we are not in the Scythiam wilds,
and though you are comfortably lodged, yet the wind howls outside as
loudly and the frost bites as keenly.'

7. venti& Bentley wished to alter to ‘sentis,' in order to avoid the
double ablative ‘ strepitu,’ ‘ventis,’ and the rather harsh zeugma by
which ‘audis’ is constructed with ‘ut glaciet nives.’ But compare Ι.
14. 6 and Virg. Aen. 4. 490 ‘ mugire videbis Sub pedibus terram et
descendere montibus ornos.'

S. puro numine. ‘ Numen* is divine power in exercise; ‘numine
glaciet nives‚’ as Virg. Aen. 4. 269 ‘caelum et terras qui numine tor-
quet? ‘ Pur0,’ of a clear sky, as ⁶ Iuppiter uvidus,’ ‘ f1·igidus‚’ etc. The
ancients had observed that cold is greater with a cloudless sky.

10. ‘ Lest rope and wheel run back together? Clearly a proverbial
expression, though the origin is uncertain. The best illustration is that
quoted from Lucian: σὺ δὲ πάνυ χαλεπὴ ἀεὶ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ γεγένησαι, καὶ
ὅρα μὴ κατὰ τὴν παροιμίαν ἀπορρήξωμεν πάνυ τεὶνασαι τὸ καλώδιον. This
would seem to give the image of lifting weights by a pulley. If the
rope be drawn too roughly or too far it will break, the wheel will spin
round the wrong way, and the weight fall back again. Lyce must not

overdo her coyness, or she will exhaust the patience of Venus and of her
lover.
