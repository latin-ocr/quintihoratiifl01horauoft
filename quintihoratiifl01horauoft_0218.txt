182 HORA TII CARMJNUM

Ulixei, for the form cp. Achillei, 1. 15. 34, and see Madv. ξ 58,
obs. 3.

8. Pelopis domum, the theme rather of the Greek drama than of
Epos; but Horace is probably alluding to Varius' tragedy ‘Thyestes,’
which was brought out in the year after the battle of Actium. It was
greatly admired. ‘Varii Thyestes cuilibet Graecorum comparari potest,’
Quint. 10. 1. 98.

10. lyrae potens, Od. 1. 3. 1.

vetat, see on Od. 1. 5. 10.

11. egregii, Od. 3. 25. 4, ‘ peerless.’

12. deterere, lit. ‘to wear the fine edge off’3 cp. ‘obterere,' Cic.
Verr. 2. 5. 1 ‘obteri laudem imperatoriam criminibus avaritiae,' and
‘tenuare‚’ Hor. Od. 3. 3. 72.

13. tunica tectum adamantina, χαλκοχίτωνας ‘adamas' is hard
steel.

14. pulvere m'grum. Cp. 2. 1. 22. The ‘dust' of the Trojan plain
occupies a prominent place in Homer.

16. superis parem, referring to his wounding Aphrodite and Ares,
in Hom. Il. 5; see esp. vv. 881—884 “H (sc. Pallas) νυν Τυδέος υἷον
ὑπερφίαλον Διομήδεα [μαργαίνειν ἀνέηκεν ἐπ’ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν. Ι Κύ-
πριδα μὲν πρῶτον σχεδὸν οὔτασε χεῖρ’ ἐπὶ καρπῷ, Ι αῧταρ ἔπειτ’ αὐτῷ μοι
ἐπέσσυτο δαίμονι ἶσος.

17. nos, not quite: ‘eg0‚' but generalizing, ‘1 and such as 1.’

18. sectis, ‘ pared,’ so as not to hurt, Orell.; cp. ‘ irresectum,’ Epod.
5. 47, of clawlike nails; ‘cut to a point,' Ritter. Who shall decide?
The first makes the better contrast with ⁶ aerium,’ and so with the real
battles of which these are the harmless parody. Bentley proposed
‘strictis ’ as helping the point of ‘ proelia’ by the παρὰ προσδοκίαν sub·
stitution of ‘ unguibus' for ‘ensibus,’ and as supported by Ovid's ‘ Non
timeo strictas in mea fata manus‚’ Am. 1. 6. 14.

19. vacui, see on Od. 1. 5. 10. For the omission of the first ‘sive'
see on Od. 1. 3. 16.

20. 1eves, ⁴ light-hearted much aster my wont‚' i. e. whether in love
or not, habitually given to light and fancisul themes3 ‘iocosae Musae
dediti': cp. Od. 3. 3. 69 ‘iocosae lyrae.'

ODE VII.

The natural meaning of the Ode is, ‘ The world is sull os sair spots,
but your own Tibur is the fairest. Forget your troubles, Plancus; in
camp, or here in Tibur, drown care in wine. Remember how Teucer

put a bold sace on his calamity, and found a new Salamis to make up
for the old?
