respect of most readings), D, γ, and, though not on an equality
with these, τ.

The second class is supposed to show the corrections of an
early and intelligent emender. That such διορθωτιιί existed in
early times is stated by the Pseudo-Acron on Ars Poet. 345.
And the name of one is found in the inscription which appears,
in slightly different ternis, at the end of the Epodes in λ, l,
Reg, g. ‘Vettius Agorius Basilius Mavortius V. C. et inl. (vir
clarissimus et inlustris> Excorn. Dom. exconS. ord. (Excomite
Domestico, exconsule ordinario) legi et ut potui emendavi, con-
ferente mihi magistro Felice oratore urbis Romae.' Felix is
not known, but Mavortius was consul in the year A.D. 527.
Asterius, consul 494, is similarly connected with the history
of the text of virgil. Bentley had treated this Mavortian
recension as the ultimate point to which the oldest MSS.
might be expected to take us back. Holder treats it rather
as the first, though not the worst, source of systematic corrup-
tion. In the class which he thinks owe their peculiarities to
this editing, he places B, V, with g, and in respect of some
of their readings, A, a, and λ, the first two of these being in
respect of much of their text affiliated to class one, the third
to class three.

The third class (in which rank F <εφψ>,λ’ (ΞΜ), u, π, σ, and
others) is held to be of less value, both as having been derived,
in the first instance, from more faulty originals, and as bearing
signs of later and less intelligent correction.

It rnay be observed that the tie which is imagined between
the MSS. which are classed together is confessedly a loose
one. Room is left for considerable influence of MSS. of one
class upon those of another. As a fact, there are very few
cases indeed of doubtful reading where the division of testimony
corresponds at all exactly to the three classes. Doubtless there v
are a few crucial passages where the value which is set on such
MSS. as V or B goes far to decide the choice of a reading, and
there must be more cases still where the instinctive feeling of
the trustworthiness of particular MSS. on particular points
