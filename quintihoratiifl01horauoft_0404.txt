with the wine. See Dict. Ant. s. v. ‘ calida.'

7. quota, ‘at what hour may I hope to warm myself with supper,
and so be quit of the cold which is worthy of the Peligni: a people in
the heart of the Apennines, north of Samnium. Ovid, who was a native ,
of Sulmo, one of their towns3 gives it the epithet ‘gelidus‚' Fast. 4. 81. , ἦ

9. lunae novae; Od. 3. 23. 2 ‘ nascente luna,’ where see note. The ¹
‘ new moon ⁷ means apparently the first of the month‚ on which a feast
was usual, as in Greek νουμηνία was transferred by usage so completely
from the first of the natural lunar month to the first of the calendar
month‚ that the real new moon was expressed by νουμηνία κατὰ τὴν
σελήνην, Thuc. 2. 28. For the genitive see on 3. 8. 13 ‘cyathos amici
sospitis.’

11. Horace assumes the function of‘ arbiter bibendi’ (Dict. Ant. s. v.
⁶ symposium ⁹), and proceeds (not to give orders to the servants, so there
is no need with Rutgers and Bentley to alter ‘miscentur’ to ‘ miscentor,'
but) to announce to the guests the proportions in which the wine and
water are mixed. It is a disputed point whether ‘ cyathus ’ was a name
of the ladle used for mixing: cp. Sat. Ι. 6. 117. In any case it was a
measure of capacity, the twelfth of the sextarius, which was nearly equal
to our pinti The meaning will therefore be, that the wine and water
may be mixed in the proportion of 9 to 3 or 3 to 9.

12. commodis is rendered by Orelli ‘ integris‚’ ‘ plenum modum
habentibus-,⁹ after Plautus' ‘ commodas minas‚’ i.e. of full weight ; but it
is perhaps better taken by Ritter as an adjective for an adverb, ‘ to suit
the taste of the drinkers?

13—17. It is a question whether this is a double description of the two
classes of drinkers spoken of in vv. 11, 12, the ⁶ rapt poet, with his love
for the Muses and their uneven numbe1·,' who ask for nine parts oswine,

and those who think rather of the Graces and their decorous fears of η

quarrels, and therefore keep to three ; or a further statement about the
one class who prefer the stronger mixture, ‘ They are moved by two
motives, their love of the nine Muses, which makes thern ask for the
full nine parts of wine, and their regard for the decorous Graces, which
restrains them from taking the additional three which would make the
liquor ·· merum'' ’. In the first case ‘tres supra’ (for their order cp. 3.
3. 11 ‘quos inter ⁵) must mean ‘more than three’; in the latter case
‘three further?
