thau an imitator. They formed part of the text in the time os Servius
(on Virg. Aen. 1. 243).

19. ρεη- omne tempus, ‘through all time,⁷ historically.

20. Amazonia, such as the Amazons used; ‘securigerae puellae]
Ov. Her. 4. 117. Horace would suggest apparently in this word that
there is some mythical reason sor their carrying the weapon. There
need not have been any definite legend, such as Porph. imagines, that
they had fought with the Amazons, or as Servius, that they traced their
descent to thern.

21. obarmet, ‘arms for offence,' a rare word, found in an epigram
(25) of Ausonius.

22. The termination of the digression in a moral saying, with a rapid
return to the straight course of the narrative, is after Pindar. ‘Sed,'
like δ’ οὖν in the Greek tragediam, implies a return to the thread of the
story, ‘ however that may be.'

24. revictae, ‘ conquered in their turn,' answering to ‘victrices'

25. mene, rather of the intellect; indoles of the temper and dis-
positions; rite, faustiS, penetralibus, are all words with religious
associations. The editors are divided on the question whether the
sentence should be stopped, as in the text, the construction being ⁶ quid
mens rite nutrita . . quid indoles rite nutrita . . posset’3 or with the
comma after ‘mens,' so that the construction would be ‘quid mens
posset, quid indoles rite nutrita‚’ etc.‚ a distinction being made between
their mental gifts, which were all their own, and their dispositions,
which needed the good training of Augustus. Sense, rhythm, and the
balance of the verse are alike in favour of the former. For ‘ posset‚'
‘nutrita,‘ with two subjects, see on 1. 3. 10.

29. fortibus et- bom's, the ablative with ‘creantur‚’ as with ‘ nasci?
etc. ‘Fortis et bonus’ is almost a formula3 Epp. 1. 9. 13 ⁶ et fortem
erede bonumque? Ritter draws attention to the conjunction ‘Nerones
fortes,’ etc.‚ as meaning, ‘remember they were Neros to begin with,’
the name Nero being, according to Suetonius (Tib. 1), a Sabine adjec-

tive signifying ‘ fortis ac strenuus.’ N otice also that ‘Nerones ' is the ·

climax—Augustus' care, care fatherly‚ care spent on such a good stock.
The thought is, ‘ It is true that scions of a good stock must be good in
men as well as in animals, but yet education improves the native gift?
Bentley points out that a misunderstanding of the first line of the stanza‚
as though the point was that given good children you may be sure they
had good parents (instead of as it is, that given good parents you may
be sure of good children), led to the false punctuation of many MSS.
and editions, which put a comma after ‘ sortibus '; so that ‘ bonis ⁷ be-
comes an epithet of ‘iuvencis,’ and the sentiment of v. 30, instead of
being general, ‘ good blood tells in bullocks and in horses,’ is nan-owed
