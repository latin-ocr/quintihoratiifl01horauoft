NOTES. BOOKI, ODE XX. 213

The metaphorical use of ‘lubricus ' in the sense of ‘ hazardous ' is eom-
mon in Cicero. For the infin. see App. 2. ξ 2.

10. The Scythians, with the Parthians and the Spaniards, represent
to Horace the foreign politics of the time, the glory that Augustus’
arms were always about to win or had won, ep. Od. 2. 11. 1, 3. S. 16,
etc„ and Introd. to Odes i—iii. ἐξ 7, 8.

11. versis equis, Od. 2. 13. 18 ⁸ sagittas et celeris fugam Parthi’;
Virg. G. 3. 31 ‘ Fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis)

12. nee quae nihjl attinent, ‘nor aught that is irrelevant,' sc. to
her, and to love, to my proper themes: that he does not add such a
qualification may be possibly meant to show that he is already absorbed
in the thoughts of love3 he‘ is no longer speaking of them from out·
side.

13. vivum caespitem, a fresh cut turf sor a temporary altar. Od.
3. 8. 4 ‘ acerra thuris Plena . . positusque carbo in Caespite vivo!

14. verbenas, Od. 4. 11. 16 ‘ ara castis vincta verbenis ' ; Virg. Aen.
12. 120 ‘verbena tempora vincti’3 Yirg. E. 8. 65 ‘verbenas adole
pingues et mascula thura.’ Explained (by Servius on Virg. Aen. l. c.,
Donatus on Ter. Andr. 4. 3. 11, and Acron on this place) as the name
of all green things, boughs or leaves of myrtie, bay, olive. etc„ or
even grass gathered ‘ ex puro loco ' and used in a religious rite. The
quotations given show that they were used sor several purposes in a
sacrifice.

15. bimi. New wine was used in sacrifices, cp. Od. 1. 31. 2, 3.
²3· 3; ‘bimi' will therefore probably mean ‘last year's wine‚’ which
would be used till the wine of the year was ready.

meri, wine with any admixture of water was unfit sor religious uses,
Fest. S. v. ‘spurcum.’

16. veniet lenior, opposed to ‘ in me tota ruens‚’ v. 9. The over-
powering and painful ‘ afflatus ' of a god was a sign of disfavour rather
than of favour, and would be mitigated by submission and reverence.
See Od. 2. 19.

ODE XX.

An invitation to Maecenas to visit Horace at his Sabine sarm, where
he will have not indeed the Caecuban or Falemian which he drinks at
home⁷ but Sabine wine, if cheap yet carefully bottled by Horace him-
self, and carrying in its date a pleasant reminiscence of Maecenas' life,
viz. of the rounds of applause with which he was received on first
entering ‘the¹ theatre after an illnes.
