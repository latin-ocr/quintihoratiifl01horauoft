176 HORA TII CARMJNUM

26. per vetitum nefas, ⁶ through sin, despite of prohibitions.’

27. Iapeti genus, Prometheus ; ⁰ genus' as the Greek γένος. Σισύφου
γένος, sor Ulysses, Eur. Cycl. 104; cp. Sat. 1. 6. 12 ¹ Laevinum Valeri
genus.⁸

23. fraude mala, ‘ an unhappy theft? There seems to be no in-
stance of ‘ fraus’ in a neutral sense, otherwise we might take it as a
parallel os Cicero’s ‘ malus dolus‚' Off. 3. 15.

30. macies, ‘ wasting sickness‚' not to be distinguished srorn the
‘febres' The things coupled are the effect of the severs and their
number.

31. incubuit, ἐπέσκηψεν, Lucret. 6. 1141 ‘ morbifer aestus Incubuit
populo Pandionis,' ‘ sell upon‚' like a storm, or a bird of prey.

32. necessitas, with ‘ leti,’ ‘ the doom of death? Horace elsewhere
personifies ‘Necessitas' (Od. 1. 35. 17, 3. 1. 14, 3. 24. 6), but it is
doubtful whether one person could be said ‘ corripere gradum’ of
another.

36. perrupit Acheronta. For the lengthening of the short syllable,
cp. Od. 2. 6. 14 ‘Angulus ridet, ubi ’ς 2. 13. 16 ‘ Caeca timet aliunde’;
5. 16. 26 ‘quidquid arat impiger.' In all these cases the metrical
necent falls on the lengthened syllable. lt is· noticed that this licence
does not occur in the Fourth Book of Odes nor in the Epistles.

Herculeus labor, not without reference to the Greek βίη Ἡρακλείη,
but as in all Horace's imitations of the idiom, with a more definite
purpose and emphasis on the substantive. ‘ Labor ' does not represent
an inert or habitual epithet. ‘ It was a labour of Hercules to burst the
barrier of Acheron.’ Cp. Od. 3. 21. 11 ‘ Narratur et prisci Catonis
Saepe mero caluisse virtus’; Sat. 2. 1. 72 ‘Virtus Scipiadae et mitis
sapientia Laeli.’

37. ardui, so V and the majority of older MSS„ though a fair pro-
portion have ‘arduumff The gen. is supported by Horace's custom,
Epp. 2. 1. 51 ‘ Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri)

33. A proverbial impossibilsty, Pind. P. 10. 41 ὁ χάλκεος οὐρανὸς
οὔποτ’ ἀμβατὸς αὐτῷ.

40. iracunda fulmina, ‘the bolts of his wrath.' The epithet pro-
perly belongs to Jove himself5 cp. Od. 1. 37. 7 ‘ dementes ruinas!

ODE IV.

The lesson of the Ode is the same, though not so explicitly put,
as that of Od. 4. 7 ‘Immortalia ne speres monet annus.‘ ‘We have
spring once more, all nature is enjoying itself. Take thy fill of pleasure‚
sestius, for death, which comes to rich and poor alike, will soon bebere,
and then no more pleasures: 1
