NOTES. BOOKIV, ODE IV. 415

waters and the metaph. of ‘equitavit’ are (lue to Eur. Phoen. 209
περιρρύτων ὑπὲρ ἀκαρπίστων πεδίων Σικελίας Ζεφύρου πνοαῖς ἱππεύσαντος,
κ.τ.λ. In its simple sense, and as a matter of construction. the verb
belongs to llanniba15 metaphorically and with a zeugma, it supplies
also the verb of ‘ flamma' and ¹ Eurus.’

45. secundis laboribus crevit, grew ever more and more successful
in its entcrprises; the ablativo as in 3. 30. 8 ‘crescam laude.'

46. impio, because they affronted Roman gods.

47. Poenorum tumultu. A ‘ tumultus’ was a sudden and danger- -
ous war on or within the borders, usually a Gallie or ltalian one.
Cicero explains its nature in Phil. 8. 1. Cp. especially, ‘ ltaque maiores
nostri tumultum Italicum quod erat domesticus, tumultum Gallicum
quod erat Italiae finitimus, praeterea nullum tumultum nominabant.'
The expression, then, in the text is almost an oxymoron, ‘ a war with
Carthaginians, but yet a war in our own borders.’

48. deos rectos, of the images thrown down by Hannibal, and now
set on their pedestals again.

49. The speech of Hannibal is founded on the saying actually attri-
buted to him by Livy on learning of Hasdrubal's defeat and death:
‘tanto simul publico familiarique ictus luctu, agnoscere se fortunam
Karthaginis fertur dixisse‚' Liv. 27. 51.

perfidus. It was the stock charge against him. Livy speaks of his
‘perfidia plusquam Punica‚' 21. 4.

51. ultro, aggressively, needlessly.

opimus triumphus, ‘ a rare triumph‚' a phrase coined by Horace to
the model of ‘ spolia opima.'

53. gens. ‘ These armies that we have been provoking are to us as
wolves to deer. Remember the story and character of the Roman
people generally.’ The stanza is a re'sume' of the story of the Aeneid.
Cp. especially Aen. 1. 1-7‚ 67, 68.

cremato fortis ab Ilio. Grammatically ‘ab Ilio' answers to ‘ad
urbes Ausonias‚' and ‘ fortis' qualifies ‘pertulit'3 but the collocation
which pairs ‘ fortis’ with ‘ cremato,’ and makes ‘ ab Ilio ' follow closely
and apparently depend on ‘ fortis ’ (‘ stepping forth in strength from the
ashes of Ilium ⁹), is meant to suggest the idea of the next stanza, that
their very calamities only gave them fresh heart and vigour. They
rise like the Phoenix from its pyre. Vv. 53, 54 contrast the perils of
fire and of water.

54. iactata, probably agreeing with ‘gens,' ‘ for all their tossing on
the Tuscan sea.' ‘ Multum ille et tern's iactatus et alto,’ Virg. Aen. 1. 3.

sacra; Virg. Aen. 1. 68, 2. ²93-

56. pertulit, of perseverance through difficulty, and of success.

Δ 57. duris; see on 3.11. 31, Epod. 5. 30.
