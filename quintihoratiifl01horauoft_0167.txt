CARMEN SECULARE. 1 31

‘Seculares’ before that date, and what is said of the different
celebrations goes to show that they were called forth by special
emergencies, not by any recurrence of epochs. still, there
would seem to have been some tradition of such recurrence to
justify Augustus' revival. On the dates of the celebrations
Censorinus’ authorities differed. The length of the ‘seculum'
itself was diversely given at 110, as by Horace, and 100 years,
as by Val. Antias, Livy, and Varro, whom Censorinus quotes,
The historical performances are at varying periods, but all
with some reference to an intended secular date. Merivale
writes, ‘ The emperor Claudius repeated the garnes in the year
A.U. C. 800, disregarding those of Augustus as irregular. Clau-
dius was disregarded in his turn by Domitian, who renewed
the celebration in 841, anticipating in his impatience, by six
years, the period prescribed by Augustus. To the Augustan
computation Severus conformed precisely, and repeated the
solemnity in 957, aster two intervals of 110 years each. Philip-
pus, however, returned once more to the precedent of Claudius
in the year of the City 1000. This was the last celebration.'
The occasion of Augustus' revival or institution of these
games was the close of what may be considered the first decade
of the empire, the renewal to him (though professedly only for
five years more), at his own request, of the ‘imperium,' which
in Rc. 27 he had, apparently with difficulty, been persuaded to
accept for ten years.
¹ The ‘quindecimviri' (see on v, 70, and cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 73),
he custodiaris of the Sibylline Books, found in thern the requi-
ite instructions. Ateius Capito, a great jurist and anfiquary,
as appointed to settle the ceremonies, and Horace to corn-
ose the hymn. Some doubt has been entertained whether
his was to be performed in the temple of Apollo Palatinus on
he third day of the festival (see below, extract from Zos. l. 33),
r during the sacrifices at the Tarentum on the first night
