256 ΗΘΚΛ Tll CARMINA.

Hector Tradidit. . . Pergama Graiis.' Horace, in the desire to omit
Antony⁷s name, does not distinguish his fleet, which was totally
destroyed, from that of Cleopatra. which fled without striking a
blow.

14. lymphatam, ‘panic-stricken.' ΡιόρεῑῙγενυμφόπληκτον, panic
terrors being attributed to the agency, amongst other deities, of the
Nymphs; but the word, like panis itself, is generalized. Here the
effect is attributed to her revels with Antony and the deep draughts of
Egyptian wine, for Bacchus too is the author of such empty fears: cp.
Eur. Bacch. 303 foll. στρατὸν ’γὰρ ἐν ὅπλοις ὅντα κάπὶ τάξεσι φόβος
διεπτόησε πρῖν λόγχης θιγεῖν· μανία δὲ καῖ τοῦτ’ ε’στῖ Διονύσου πάρα. It
is opposed to ‘veros timores? ‘the sears of soberness’

Mareotico, a sweet wine from Marea, a town of the Delta, mentioned
but not characterized by Virg. G. 2. 91.

16. ab Italia, not that she had reached Italy, but that it was the
object of the ambitious schemes broken down at Actium. A few of
Octavius' ships seem to have pursued Cleopatra for a short way, but
she escaped safely to Alexandria. Horace marks no interval between
this and' the autumn of the following year, when Octavius followed, to
put a close to the war at Alexandria, and Antony and Cleopatra escaped
his hands by a voluutary death.

20. Haemoniae, poetical name of Thessaly, mythically derived from
Haemon, the father of Thessalus. The epithet probably only implies
‘ in winter‚' the appropriate time for hunting.

21. monstrum quae, a common constructio ad sensum. Cicero
calls Catiline ‘monstrum’ Cat. 2. 1; Lucan calls Cleopatra ‘Latii
feralis Erinnys‚' 10. 59.

22. nec , . ensem. According to Plutarch (Ant. 79) she attempted
to stab herself on the approach of Proculeius, Augustus' emissary, but
was prevented. The next line and a half have reference perhaps to
a plan which, on the same authority (ib. 69), she is said to have enter—
tained of carrying her fleet across the isthmus, and escaping down the
Red Sea.

24. reparavit, a word ofdoubtful sense, but found in all the MSS.
and interpreted by the Schol. Porph. took it as a pregnant expression
=⁵ ad latentes oras fugit ut vires inde repararet.⁷ It rnay mean no more
than ‘found some fresh land out of the way of Caesar's vengeance.' It
may also mean (see on 1. 31. 1 2) ‘purchased‚' ‘used her fleet to win for
herself,' and there may be in it a more or less conscious remembrance
of the Greek uses of ἀμείβειν and ἀλλάττειν, for ‘to go to' some new
place. Bentley proposed ‘penetravit‚' and there have been many other
conjectures—⁴ citare paraxitf ‘ire paravit‚’ ‘repetivit,' etc.
