APPENDIX III.

INDEX OF METRES USED IN THE ODES AND
EPODES.

ξ 1. Asclepz'ads.
Under this system are included five systems‚ composed of the
following verses singly or in various combinations 2-—
α. The lesser Asclepiad—

— — — υψ- -υυ -υΞ

Maecenas atavis edite regibus.
β. The greater Asclepiad—

---·υυ--υυ- - υυ- υΞ

Tu ne quaesieris scire nefas quem mihi quem tibi.

In these two verses the caesura is carefully kept, in a after
the first, in β after the second choriambus. The only exception
in Horace's writings is Od. 4. 8. 17 ‘ Non incendia Carthaginis
impiae.’ In 1. 18. 16 and 2. 12. 25, the preposition gives a quasi-
caesura.

γ. The Glyconic—

---υυ-υΞ

Nil mortalibus ardui est.

In two instances‚ in Od. 1. 15. 24 and 36, Horace returns to
the use of Catullus, and has a trochee as the ‘basis,' ‘ Teucer et
Sthenelus sciens‚' ‘ Ignis Iliacas domos.'

δ. The Pherecratic*
