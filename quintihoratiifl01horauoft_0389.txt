41. ‘Like lionesses that have come o'n a herd of calx-es, are rencling,
ah me! each her own.’ She imagines what is even now passing in each
chamber. ‘ Lacerant’ continues the image of the lionesses; the simile
passes into a metaphor.

45-47. me, me, ‘I don't care sor myself, is I can save you3 my father
may load me with chains, if you go free srom the prisowhousef The
antithesis is the same as in the epitaph quoted on v. 51.

46. clemens msere. For the relation of the adjectives see on 1.
3. 10.

49. pedes et aurae. The two are alternatives, for she means ‘fly
either by land or sea,' as it is put more fully in Epod. 16. 21 ‘Ire pedes
quocunque serent, quocunque per undas Notus vocabit;' so that this
must be added to the many instances in which the Latin (and Greek)
poets put conjunctively, as possibilities united in the fact of their being
offered at the same time, what we should put disjunctively as alternative
possibilities which cannot be realized at the same time. See on Od. 1.
3. 9, 3. 27. 5, Epod. 2. 133 compare Virg. G. 2. 25 ‘Quadrifidasque
sudes et acuto robore vallos‚’ which describes two altemative modes of
treating the ‘stirpes’ of the preceding verse; and Virg. Aen. 2. 645
‘miserebitur hostis exuviasque petet,’ of the different motives‚ one or
other of which will induce some enemy to kill Anchises.

rapiunt has the inceptive force of the present, ‘ are waiting to snatch
thee away.’

51. nostri=‘ mei‚' as 3. 27. 14 ‘Et memor nostri, Galatea, xivas?

sepulchro, ‘ on my tomb3' perhaps a ceuotaph, as the ‘ Hectoreus
tumulus' of Virg. Aen. 3. 304. Ovid (Her. 14. 127) understands it of
a request that he will actually bury her, and imagines the full epitaph
which he is to inscribe, ⁶ Exsul Hypermnestre‚ pretium pietatis iniquum,
Quam mortem fratri depulit ipsa tulit?

ODE XII.

This Ode seems to be rightly taken by Orelli and Dillr. as a soliloquy
put into the mouth of Neobule. ‘ She is one of the unhappy maidens
who can neither give free play to their love nor forget it over the wine
cup without the dread of an uncle's tierce tongue. She cannot attend
to her womanly work sor the thought of Hebrus' beauty,—Hebrus‚ as
he comes fresh from his swim in the Tiber after his morning's exercise,
for he is the best of riders‚ boxers, nmners, huntsmen.’

The older theory made it all an address of the poet to Neobule. But
in his mouth the contrast of the lot of men and women is not very
gracesul, nor the connection between vv. 1-3 and the remaindervof the
