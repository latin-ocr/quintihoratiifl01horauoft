cases ‘Orcus' or ‘Necessitas’ is represented under images borrowed
from the employment of the rich man himself. In 2. 18 he is busy plan·
ning his palaee. Death has his measuring rod too, and is planning a
home for him which he shall yet more surely tenant. Here he is laying
the foundations of his palace deep in the sea3 but who knows that Fate
may not snatch his hammer from him and ‘ drive the last nails into ‘the
gable-top’ herself? He will have the toil, but he will not finish the
work himself. Death will stop him. We may remember that ‘nails
sor building‚' ‘clavi trabales‚‘ are already a recognised implement of
‘Necessitas‚’ 1. 35.18; so that Horace would say, ‘You are building.
Fate is a builder as well as you. and she may finish your house for you.'

Γ») The plural ‘ verticibus ' may be explained as generalising‚—‘ the tops of

your palaces‚’ for he is building in every sea‚—or of the different points
to which the roos rises. Two other explanations have been given to
‘ summis verticibus? (Ι) Bentley's—of the nails‚ ⁴ up to their heads ’ς
(2) that of most of the older commentators—of the heads that tower
highest, are ‘too conspicuous,’ Od. 3. 16. 19; or more definitely still,
‘of the top of the head' of the human proprietor into which D'oom
is pietured as driving her nails. Mr. Robinson Ellis has suggested
to me as parallel for this last view, Theogn. 1012 κεφαλῆς δ’ ἅπτεται
ἀκροτάτης (spoken of old age), and a fragment (3) of Rhianus in Meineke's
Anal. Alexandr. p. 199 ‘H δ’ Ἀτη ἁπαλοῖσι μετατρωχῶσα πόδεσσιν Ἀκρῇς
ἐν κεφαλῇσιν ἀνώιστος καὶ ἄφαντος Ἀλλοτε μὲν ’γραίῃσι νεωτέρη, ἄλλοτε
δ’ αὖτε εΟπλοτέρῃσιν ’γρῆυς ἐφίσταται α’μπλακίησιν Ζηνὶ θεῶν κρείοντι Δίκῃ

favour of the view first given, which is supported by Orelli and Dillr.

adamantinos, os hardest' uon, see on 1. 6 13 It does not help the
image os Fate finishing his work for him, but it suggests the further
idea of the hopelessness of struggling with Fate. It is parallel to the
images of 1. 35. 16-20. See note there.

sented as a halter round the neck, from which there is no release, ²s (we
should rather put it in prose—since tllcrc is tlze possibility that) an irre-
versible Fate has already fixed the limit of our plans.
