452 HORATJJ CARMEN SECULARE.

which appears to have been enacted in Rc. 18. Some uncertainty
hangs over its provisions, for we do not know to what extent it was
altered by the supplementary law which was passed in B.c. 9, in the
consulship of M. Papius Mutilus and Q. Poppaeus Secundus, and which
causes the whole measure to be cited as the ‘ Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea.’
It forbade marriage between persons of senaton'an family and ‘liber-
tinae,’ imposed penalties on celibaey (to the extent of the forfeiture os
all bequests) and even on childless marriages in all ranks, and held out
exemptions and rewards to the fathers of legitimate families. Dio
briefly mentions its provisions 54. 163 on the whole matter see Merivale,
c. 33, vol. iv. p. 85 foll. For another reference to Augustus‘ legislation
on this subject see Od. 4. 5. 21, and cp. Od. 1. 2. 24.

19. prolis feraei; Od. 4. 4. 58 ‘feraci frondis in Algido ': cp. 3. 6.
17 and inf. v. 29 ‘ fertilis frugum!

20. marita, as an adjective, ‘the marriage law'; so Prop. 4. 11. 33
‘ facibus maritis,’ Ov. Her. 12. 87 ‘sacris maritis?

21. certus . . orbis, ‘that so the cycle may be unbroken‚ and there

may never fail a thronging people to celebrate the secular games in the =
hundred and tenth year' (see Introd.). The place of ‘frequentes' .?

shews that it is emphatic.
22. For the position of que see on Od. 1. 30. 6.

2 3. ter die claro, i.e. on three successive days.
25. veraces cecinisse; see App. 2, ξ 2. The perfect tense, because

he is concerned, not with their prophecies generally, but with their pro· Α,

phecies of Rome's destiny ; see on 3. 4. 51.

Parcae; see on v. 14. Orelli reminds us that they would be the ἦ

authors of the Sibylline prophecies.

with ‘bona iungite fata,’ in a similar construction to ‘ quod felix faust- ι
umque sit,’ ete„ ‘As once and for aye has been promised—and Time's l
landmark, that may not be removed, protect the promise !—-1ink happy 3

destinies to those already accomplished.⁷ In ‘dictum est,' Horace is
remembering the etymology of ‘fatum.' In ‘rerum Terminus’ he is

possibly thinking of the landmark of Roman empire that might never ·

recede, and its pledge in the statue of Terminus, who would not give
way even to Jupiter on the Capitol (Ov. Fast. 2. 667 foll.); but the

metaphorical use occurs in Virg. Aen. 4. 614 ⁶ Et sic fata Iovis poscunt, ,

hic terminus haeret,' where we have reminiscences of Accius, Fr. ‘veter
fatorum terminus‚’ and Lucr. 1. 78 ‘ alte terminus haerens? Orelli reads
⁵ servat‚' after the Aldine edition (Lambinus praises, but does not print
it). It has the slightest MS. support, and, as Bentley remarks, looks
like a correction to suit the mood of ‘ est.³ The sentence ‘ quod . . servat,'
would then be constructed as the object of ‘ cecinisse.'
