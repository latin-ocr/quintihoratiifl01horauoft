250 HORA TII CARMIM4.

and loyal friends are said to cling to her when she changes her garb and
leaves the home of greatness. Hope and loyal friends are consolations
of adversity, so that Horace must mean not that they go with Fortune
when she deserts a man, but that they cling to him, to his changed estate
as to his unchanged. Yet if this is the case, in what sense is she said to
be ‘inimica ’? On whom does she frown? A man deserted by Fortune,
suffering under the illtreatment of Fortune, is a common picture, but it is
a conception of Fortune which, if it suits the earlier stanzas of the Ode,
is at variance with the general tone of this one. Fortune‚ according to
this, does not drive the great man from his palaee, nor fly from him and
leave him in it to calamity‚ but goes with him. She ‘ changes her garb‚'
but only as he would himself; it is the common Roman habit of putting
011 3 sad-coloured dress 111 a time of misfortune (cp. Epod. 9. 28 ‘ punico
Lugubre mutavit sagum ⁷).

26. cadis siccatis, cp. the Greek proverb ζεῖ χύτρα ζῇ φιλία.

28. ferre iugum pariter dolosi. ‘ Ferre ’ (lepends not on the whole
idea of ‘dolosi‚' but on the positive attribute which is denied in it.
ί Νο1 honest in bearing,’ ‘ no loyal yoke-fellows.’ The metaphor is
common. The yoke sometimes, as perhaps here, has a reference to the
labours or troubles that friendship shares and lightens. Aesch. Ag. 842
ἕτοιμος ἧν ἐμοὶ σειραφόρος, St. Paul, Phil. 4. 3 σύζυγε γνήσιε, Ον. Trist.
5. 2. 39 ‘ Me miserum quid agam si proxima quaeque relinquunt? Sub·
trahis effracto tu quoque colla iugo.’ Sometimes, as Theoc. 12. 15
ἀλλήλους ἐφίλησαν ἴσῳ ζύγῳ, 11 only refers to the bond of love or friend-
ship which is only easy when both parties feel its weight equally.

29. ultimos, ‘ remotis . . B1·itannis‚’ Od. 4. 14. 47. Cp. Virg. E. Ι.
67 ‘penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos'3 for the genitive ‘orbis’ cp.
‘ Extremi hominum Morini‚' Virg. Aen. 8. 727.

30. recens examen, Aesch. Pers. 126 πᾶς ’γὰρ ἱππηλάτας καὶ πεδοστι-
βὴς λεὼς σμῆνος ὡς ἐκλέλοιπεν μελισσᾶν. Horace uses the metaphor of
slaves clustering round the fire. Epod. 2. 65.

32. Oceano rubro, the Indian Ocean with its two arms, the Persian
Gulf and the Red Sea. The intended expedition to Arabia did not
actually take place till ac, 24, see Introd. to Od. 1. 29.

33. cicatricum et sceleris The expression is of the nature of what
grammarians call hendiadys. In prose the ideas would be grouped more
logically. The real object of the feeling of ‘ shame' is one, viz. the
‘guilt' of civil war; the ‘ scars' are only its memorials, the ‘brother-
hood ' of the combatants its aggravation. We are not ashamed of them
in the same sense that we are ashamed of the guilt: but the feeling
of guilt comes to us through divers approaches. The poet, whose
purpose it is to wake feeling, tries them in succession.

34. fratrumque, Virg. G. 2. 510 ⁴ gaudent perfusi sanguine fratrum.’
